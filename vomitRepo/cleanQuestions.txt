Hi  Are there areas that are suitable for open water swimming   i e  swimming a couple of miles  I ll be moving to the Al Khor region if that s any help 
Any news why QL and other sites like google  etc  are intermitent today  All other website are extremely slow  except qtel website 
I have the highest speed option however lately my net has been slow and is always disconnecting  Is anyone experiencing the same thing 
the intenet is running slow like hell is any bodt experiencing any of this    i have a 1mb internet connection it used to download at 120 kb s now it about 46kb s    browsing is slow plus the internet gaming is slow from a looooong time ago personally i dont think 300 riyals a month is worth qtels s  t 
The router they provide is very weak for signal   if I go to another room   my internet disconnects    is there another router i can purchase to use to the internet access with QTEL ADSL   that has a stronger signal    
Slow at work  slow at home  started a couple weeks ago and getting progressively worse  I think Qtel is not upgrading their bandwidth fast enough to accommodate new DSL subscribers  Anyone else with mysteriously slowing DSL  When can we expect the Emiri decree for outside telecomm competition to come into effect  and rid the world of the scourge that is Qtel 
I am just getting ready to move to Doha this month and am wondering if Qtel has Vonage blocked as they seem to block everything that makes life easier  If anyone could let me know ASAP so i can atleast return this box before i leave and not waste  80 Cheers Aaron
