Or you can do what this woman did and come up with an ingenious plan to get someone else to pay for it. The woman, known only as Xiaoli, from Shenzhen in China, managed to raise around \u00a314,000 by convincing her boyfriends, all 20 of them, to each buy her an iPhone 7. She then sold the phones via the website Hui Shou Nao and made 115,010 Chine yuan (\u00a313,991), which she then used to buy a house in the countryside. According to Proud Qiaoba, who appears to work with Xiaoli, the woman is not from a wealthy family and her \u2018mum is a housewife and her dad is a migrant worker, and she is the oldest daughter.\u2019 \u2018Her parents are getting old and she might be under a lot pressure hoping to buy them a house\u2026 But it\u2019s still unbelievable that she could use this method!\u2019 Some people criticised her and called her \u2018shameless\u2019 but most praised her for her ingenuity. One woman wrote: \u2018I can\u2019t even find one boyfriend. She can actually find 20 boyfriends at the same time and even get them to buy her an iPhone 7. Just want to ask her to teach me such skills."}

He rushes quickly because today is a special day! He will not be attending any of the cult's daily rituals, as today marks one of the cult's holy occasions. Today is the cult's first winter gathering for drifting, drag racing, and other deadly car-maneuver-related activities. What makes today extra special is that it is his first time performing. Today he moves away from the spectator's status. Today marks his official inauguration into the high ranks of the cult. It took him a while to become cool enough, and to advance in the coolness hierarchy to be acknowledged today as a performer, rather than a mere spectator.  With raging speed, Mainstream Ahmad runs out of the house and into his land cruiser, making his way to Tea Time to get his morning dose of the holy water\u2014muggles call it karak. He picks up the brim-filled paper cup and continues speeding to the industrial area. His cool, vintage, 1998 land cruiser is in dire need of last minute fix-ups and tweaks in preparation for his debut later tonight.  He arrives at his regular car modification garage\u2014owned by no other than his dearest pal and the guy who introduced him to the enlightened Cult, Mainstream Jassim\u2014with an empty paper cup, and gets out of his car, greeting Ali and Mahmoud, the very friendly and kind shopkeepers of the garage. With one nod, they know what to do, and nod back in an assuring manner.  They know tonight is Mainstream Ahmad\u2019s big night, and they plan on doing everything they can to make sure it goes perfectly. After all, their jobs depended on it, or so they have been warned by their very \u201cpleasant\u201d Kafeel, Mainstream Jassim, who wants to make sure his dear disciple gets the perfect induction ceremony tonight.  \u00a0 Mainstream Ahmad keeps on inspecting the work of Ali and Mahmoud like a US customs officer searching a bearded brown man about to enter Trumpville. He is focused on every single detail in the modification and tuning process, making sure the two poor guys who have to deal with his very \u201cmild\u201d demeanor are not missing anything.  \u201cTonight will be perfect\u201d, he screams internally at his projected image on the reflection of his car\u2019s heavily tinted windows\u2014although prohibited, he still has them tented as a sign of rebellion and a symbolism of his allegiance to the ostracized Cult.  Hours pass by and evening arrives, as darkness befalls the skies around Sina\u2019iya, alerting the three fellows that they need to wrap up. The cruiser is almost ready. The only thing remaining for him is to install the new set of fresh tires he bought just for today. \u201cThose skid marks I leave behind will be darker than my smoke-filled lungs\u201d, he thought to himself, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure those fresh tires don\u2019t even last the whole night.\u201d  A faint melody of a very old and ghetto Salamah Al-Abdullah song is heard echoing inside as he steals a few minutes for a quick smoke outside the garage. \u201cOh sh**, it\u2019s my phone! This must be my dear master Mainstream Jassim calling to see how the modification is going.\u201d He throws the half-smoked cigarette and rushes inside.  He grabs the phone only to find the call to be from his younger brother, Underdog Khalid. With a dissatisfied scoff he answers, \u201cWhat do you want Khallood? I\u2019m busy.\u201d \u201cLoving the warm greeting brother, I\u2019m overwhelmed with emotions.\u201d Replies Khalid sarcastically.  \u201cYeah I\u2019m full of love. Get to the point, nerd.\u201d  \u201cDad is asking about you. He\u2019s upset and thinks you went to race with those half-witted, sad excuses of human beings, cool boy wannabe, friends of yours. Just giving you a heads up. Expect one hell of a punishment.\u201d  Mainstream Ahmad clenches his teeth in anger at what he just heard. How dare that stupid low life nerd brother of his disrespect the name of the great Cool Guys\u2019 Cult. He decides to move on and keep the secrecy of his situation intact. Confidentiality is key to the survival of the cult, or so did his masters tell him.  \u201cGo away Khallood, I can handle my sh**.\u201d He says as he hangs up in his younger brother\u2019s face.  Preparations for Mainstream Ahmad\u2019s inauguration conclude, and it is time for him to head out to the site of the ceremony. He bids Ali and Mahmoud farewell as he gets in his car and starts the engine, urging them to pray for tonight to go well for him, to which they begrudgingly do with a couple of fake smiles.  It is almost time.  Mainstream Ahmad feels more and more nervous as he makes his way to the holy ceremony, repeating to himself: \u201cI\u2019ll make my masters proud.\u201d In a sea of blackness, darker than a Dukhan oil rig, rests an old, secluded, street on the very far edges of Wakrah, bordering the sandy and beautiful sea of dunes known by the name of Al-Nigyaan. Udaid and Abu Samra are not that far away. The lonely, single-lane, two-way road awaits patiently for the occasional car to pass by, mostly carrying weekend campers seeking a good place to set up a tent, or residents of Wakrah seeking a shortcut, or contractors who lost their way to M\u2019sae\u2019eid.  The lonely street is consoled by a sense of purpose that it started feeling ever since the great Cult declared it a ceremonial holy location, where their secluded, secret, and very prestigious rituals of aimless drifting take place. After all, such rituals must remain secret, as, just like many religious minorities, the Cult has been subject to discriminatory prosecution in almost any country it resides in, due to erroneous allegations of their involvement in life-threatening rituals\u2014the Cult\u2019s designated spokesperson would swear to you on his dead (but actually alive) mother\u2019s grave that these allegations are false and have been propagated by heretic and hating apostates who lost their way and left the Cult to join the muggle (regular) social order.  Tonight, the lonely street feels lonely no more. Tonight it will be a busy street like its brothers and cousins, and other distant road cousins of whom it does not acknowledge\u2014mainly because they do not come from a prestigious tribal lineage of asphalt as this street does\u2014that reside in the city. Tonight the Cult will come to fill the emotional void that the lonely street had always felt, even if only for a few hours. The black veil of the moonless night starts to get gradually ruptured by increasing numbers of full-beam headlights, moving in excessive speed. The Cult is assembling. The lonely street feels lonely no more.  Cars start assembling on both sides of the road, leaving the road empty and well lit for the performers to commence their rituals. Mainstream Jassim gives Mainstream Ahmad the usual cheesy nonsense about how far he has come, how he is very proud of him, and how it has been a pleasure seeing him evolve into the amazing Cool Guy he has become. A single tear is shed and immediately hidden from both sides\u2014because Cool Guys don\u2019t cry\u2014and Mainstream Ahmad makes his way to the scene of the ritual.  Mainstream Jassim takes his place on the side of the road, and watches proudly as he witnesses his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 make his debut. Mainstream Ahmad glues his feet to the throttle as he makes his way to the drifting area, while little Mainstream Cool Kids in spectator seats are looking at him in awe, impatient to be in his place in the future.  Mainstream Ahmad prepares to make his first maneuver with his hands impatiently holding the emergency brake on his right side, waiting for the right time to pull it. He pulls, and the sea of darkness drowns the street again\u2026. A heavy tear falls on top of Underdog Khalid\u2019s face; as he listens to the Imam go through the instructions for the prayer of the deceased. Out of all the places he would have expected to end up in this morning, Abu Hamoor cemetery wouldn\u2019t have been within his expectations. In a sandy forest of graves, stands Khalid next to his kin, friends, and random do-gooders who heard about the tragic calamity and decided to come and recite some prayers for the soul of the deceased.  The paramedics at the hospital were puzzled as they told the family what happened. An anonymous phone call about an accident came in at the call center, and when they responded, they found a vintage 1998 land cruiser, flipped upside down in the middle of the pitch-black night. No soul was to be seen around. They looked inside to find the body, and they went on with the usual procedure.  That image kept floating in Khalid\u2019s head as he glimpsed towards one end of the crowds gathered around the grave to see Mainstream Jassim and the rest of the Cult\u2019s great masters with dim faces, hiding behind sunglasses and Ghutras wrapped around their faces, whispering to each other about what a great martyr he was, and how his name will forever be remembered in the history of the great Cult.  \u00a0 He keeps looking in utter disdain. \u201cThey killed my brother. He was a sad excuse of a human being, but he was my brother. They will get away with it because nobody knows,\u201d he thinks to himself with pure depression and heartbreak.  The look of sadness on his face turns into that of anger\u2026: \u201cBut I know\u2026\u201d To be continued..."}

A single can of cola contains about 10 teaspoonful of sugar, 30-35 milligrams of caffeine and is loaded with harmful artificial flavours and colouring. However, the major culprit in the cola ingredient list is the high-fructose corn syrup. High- fructose corn syrup is derived from fructose, a cheaper sweetener made from corn. The harmful thing about fructose is not only its high sugar content but their effects on the metabolic rate that is, the rate at which a person\u2019s body digests and absorbs food. It may actually inhibit the digestive process. Cola also contains phosphoric acid the last thing one would want to put in his body. Phosphoric acid harms the body\u2019s ability to absorb calcium which could lead to softening of teeth and bones, and eventually to osteoporosis. How does the human body react after one drinks a glass of cola? During the first 10 minutes the 10 teaspoons of sugar begins to hit the body. This amount of sugar is the    The overwhelming sweetness is not vomited out because the phosphoric acid cuts the flavor and allows it to keep it down. During the next 20 minutes, the blood sugar levels in the body begin to spike. This leads to an insulin burst into the system. The liver then responds by turning into fat any sugar it gets its hands on. And there is plenty of it in the body at that moment. After 40 minutes the body has completely absorbed the caffeine, the pupils begin to dilate and the blood pressure rises. The liver reacts to these changes. After 45 minutes the body ups its dopamine production that triggers the pleasure centres of the brain which is the same way in which heroin works. After about 60 minutes, the phosphoric acid binds calcium, magnesium and zinc in the lower intestine giving a momentary boost to metabolism. The caffeine\u2019s diuretic properties come into play making one feel the need to relieve oneself. Finally, once these processes stop and the cola has passed through the system, an experience of \u201csugar crash\u201d will be felt. This will give the feeling of sluggishness and maybe add to feeling thirsty once again. This feeling arises because the body has already got rid of all the water in the cola."}

I can eat what I want, without fear of pork and/or alcohol being in my food.  It's amazing - but I experienced greater freedom in Qatar than I did as Muslim women in the West. I remember being asked by another Western Muslim here \"why do you wear the abaya\" and I simply responded \"because I can\". We have a common narrative in North America that where Islam doesn't fit with our North American culture - then we, Muslims, need to change it.  It's silly, the faith is meant to be preserved, it's not meant to be changed on the whims of people. \u00a0Imagine what people 100 years ago would have changed, or a hundred years before that? \u00a0We wouldn't have a faith left if we had always changed what we didn't like in our generation or time.  Now, that conversation has arrived on the shores of Qatar, basically if Islam does not fit with what we perceive as a first world modern identity, then we need to discredit our sunnah, our Quran, our tafseers, everything - so we can hopefully fit the hollywood standard of modern day society. \u00a0 I see this conversation more and more with youth. \u00a0With globalization, everyone in all corners of the globe are having the same discussions, thoughts, and ideas. \u00a0And honestly, that is a pretty great thing.  But we need to assess how Muslims can enter that global conversation, or sphere, without feeling - well... that they need to be less Muslim. \u00a0 The faith has benefits that sometimes need to be practiced in order to be reaped. \u00a0But the further and further we walk away from elements of our faith, the further we get from ever experiencing those benefits.  I can only relay this personal story to convey this message. \u00a0The night prayer, aka Qiyaam Ul Layl, was something I thought was reserved for the sheikhs, Imams and scholars of the world. \u00a0Five prayers seemed like more than enough to me, I am just a \"normal\" Muslim after all.  As I got older I happened to to have a conversation with someone that told me to try it. \u00a0They said Qiyaam prayer delivers a sense of peace with which no other physical action could deliver. They made a good sell and I decided to try it. \u00a0I remember waking the first night, super excited to be taking on this journey and ecstatic to reap the peaceful benefits and solace this prayer was known to deliver. \u00a0Thus, at midnight, I woke and prepared for the prayer. \u00a0After the prayer, I concluded it was just a prayer, disappointingly there was no magnificent effect.  Still, I remained committed to the prayer, day after day, week after week, and month after month. Finally, it reached a point, when I finally felt it, a sense of true solace that joined me with every night prayer. \u00a0I hadn't quite experienced anything similar... ever. I would actually look forward \u00a0to performing the prayer. This peace transcended into my regular daily life as well, and began to slowly change me as a person. \u00a0Simply put, it beat any exotic vacation, spa treatment, etcetra. \u00a0 During that period, I distinctly remember getting an email from a friend I hadn't spoken to in years. \u00a0The email was quite simple \"Dear A - I had a dream about you that you were really truly happy - and I felt I needed to get in touch. \u00a0Your truly, Z.\"  Thus, once we begin the journey of abandoning aspects of our faith, we also bid farewell to the benefits those things brought us, whether we recognized them or not.  So before you walk away from aspects of your faith try them out, wholly and sincerely, first. \u00a0What a shame to throw out a bag of treasure without ever looking at first :) \u00a0"}

Also, a lot of people don't prefer living alone, and like to have someone around the house, even if not at all times. If you're going to opt for shared accommodation, here are a few things you should keep in mind. No, it is not enough to meet your flatmate only once, when showing him/her your house, or vice versa. Set up a coffee, and spend a couple of hours to get to know each other before you decide on anything. This is a great chance to ask all the right questions, and get all the answers. It might not be enough to show pictures, and take them around just your apartment. If your building complex has any other amenities like a gym, pool, etc, it might help your potential flatmate's decision making to see all what the accommodation offers. Ensure you lay down all the rules on the table, and tell your potential flatmate exactly what you want or expect out of them. And give them the opportunity to do the same. If you both are in agreement, only then does it make sense to proceed. Let your flatmate know all the costs involved in advance \u2013 like if electricity and water or internet is additional, or if not. If there are any other payments that need to be divided, they need to know well in advance, as this might be a deciding factor for many. It is important to know where your flatmate works, and what exactly he/she does for a living. Also, a new entrant in Qatar might not be aware of travel times and unknowingly choose a flat because it fits their budget. You might want to find out about everything they do and give them the right information.  \u2013 It would be ideal to have a shared agreement, but this might also be more complicated. If you want to take ownership of the flat, then do so, but make sure you have some sort of arrangement with your flatmate on record.  \u2013 Since every apartment or accommodation here requires a deposit, it is advisable to also take a deposit from your flatmate. Either take a cash advance, and give them a post-dated cheque in return, or just take a post-dated cheque for the deposit amount.  \u2013 make sure that once you have discussed all costs involved, you also devise a suitable plan to either split the bills, or take responsibility of one/all bills.  \u2013 Make sure you find your flatmate only on or through a reliable source. A website that nobody has ever heard, might not be the safest option for you to find someone to share your house with. If someone is recommending, make sure you know him or her well enough to trust his or her recommendations.  \u2013 Ensure your potential flatmate knows all about your living habits, frequency of visits from your friends and family, and everything else you think a person needs to know about you before living with you."}

So compared to Pajero 2015, the Fortuner 2012 is a lot better. cos my friend purchased a brand new and the rubber lining in the front glass and exterior is hanging and still fortuner is as good as new....

I have two main options : Mitsubishi. Pajero (3.5 /3.8) 2014-15 and Toyota Fortuner 2.7 / 4 (2015, not the new one) Plus about the pajero is that it's worth the money, it comes with so many interior options and comfort as a top level SUV of Mitsubishi, however I need to know the cost of maintainence, spares reliability & resale value. Also on forums, it's seen that Mitsubishi is going to stop Pajero soon as it's an ageing SUV. Now with the Fortuner, given that the toyota has the better resale value and low\u00a0maintainence, it's reliable. But it has cheap interior design and options. What is the opionion on it's ride comfortability as it's for family use. What would you prefer between these models? and please state your reasons. I am rather not hear about Prado. It's too expensive comparing to these models. Thanks."}

Transmission failed and a lot of issues with the doors which opened up automatically when he was driving putting his life at risk.", "commentId": "comment-7394586"}, {"username": "muad-db", "comment": "Will test drive one this week .. Joys", "commentId": "comment-7393986"}], "question": "The all-new Ford Edge demonstrates what happens when a proven leader gets even better. Available at Al Mana Motors, Ford\u2019s importer-dealer in Qatar, the original crossover utility vehicle from Ford is loaded with more technology, higher levels of craftsmanship and greatly improved vehicle dynamics. When launched in late 2006, Edge helped to define the crossover sport utility vehicle segment. With a car-based design, Edge delivered better on-road comfort, fuel efficiency and overall driving dynamics than any truck-based SUV. It was proof a utility vehicle could meet the demanding needs of an everyday commuter. The Edge is all-new from wheels to roof, designed to reset the standard in the two-row utility vehicle market. Based on Ford\u2019s successful, global midsize vehicle platform, Edge has been reimagined with a stronger, more athletic shape. It has been retooled to meet higher expectations for quality, and reengineered to add more features and technologies for a more rewarding driving experience. The Edge will deliver the confident, smooth driving experience customers expect from Ford. Central to the improved driving dynamics is an entirely new body structure and redesigned suspension \u2013 front and rear \u2013 developed specifically to better isolate road imperfection and absorb noise without compromising handling. The front-wheel-drive Edge retains a MacPherson-type front suspension, but features an entirely new, sophisticated integral-link independent rear with coil springs and a 23-millimeter antiroll bar. The advanced new system has been tuned to deliver a more dynamic, engaging ride customers will feel immediately. Thanks in part to the use of more high-strength steels, the solid body structure of the all-new Edge provides a far better platform for the new suspension to work. Compared to the 2014 Edge, the new model shows a 26 percent increase in stiffness when reacting to bending forces and a 16 percent increase in stiffness when reacting to twisting forces. This means less noise, vibration and harshness characteristics, giving Edge customers a quieter, more substantial ride. As a result, Edge is well suited for an everyday commute, but ready to attack when the road opens up. The all-new Edge will be a technology leader for Ford, with a suite of standard and available technologies designed to improve the driving experience and the level of occupant comfort. Technologies being offered for the first time include enhanced active park assist, side parking sensors and a front camera with washer. Key technology features include: \u2022 Adaptive cruise control and collision warning with brake support: Uses radar to detect moving vehicles directly ahead and change the cruising speed if necessary \u2022 Air curtain: Creates a curtain of air alongside the vehicle using smart duct work, improving aerodynamics at high speed \u2022 Blind Spot Information System: BLIS\u00ae uses radar to trigger a warning when another motorist is in the driver\u2019s blind spot \u2022 Cameras: New 180-degree front camera with washer featured for first time on a Ford vehicle; standard rear camera \u2022 Cross-traffic alert: Uses radar to help alert drivers to oncoming traffic when backing out of a parking space \u2022 Enhanced active park assist: Builds on Ford parallel parking technology and includes a system to guide the vehicle into a perpendicular parking space. The system can also steer the vehicle into and out of a parallel parking space \u2022 Forward and reverse sensing systems: The systems provide audible alerts designed to help drivers avoid obstacles when parking \u2022 Hands-free liftgate: Allows customer to move leg below center of the rear bumper to unlock and raise liftgate \u2022 Lane-keeping system: Steers vehicle back into its lane if driver allows it to drift \u2022 Side parking sensors: System uses sensors and algorithms that measure speed and steering wheel angle to warn drivers of obstacles on either side of the vehicle during parking or low-speed maneuvers \u2022 SYNC\u00ae with MyFord Touch\u00ae: Becoming available for more trim levels; standard on Edge Sport and Titanium series \u2022 Active glove box knee airbag: Advanced new design uses glove box front to cushion front seat passenger in a crash. A pliable, injection-molded plastic bladder is sandwiched between the inner and outer glove box door panels. On impact, a small inflator fills the bladder, extending the glove box outer door panel toward the passenger\u2019s legs \u2022 AdvanceTrac\u00ae with Roll Stability Control\u2122: Uses sensors to measure the roll rate of the vehicle and predict its roll angle. Based on this information and measurements from other vehicle dynamics sensors, the system can adjust engine torque and brake pressure at all four wheels to help the driver maintain control of the vehicle \u2022 Curve Control: Uses the same sensors as Roll Stability Control to detect and measure roll rate, yaw rate, lateral acceleration, wheel speed and steering wheel angle to help drivers follow their intended path by slowing the vehicle more efficiently while maneuvering a curve \u2022 Inflatable rear safety belts: An advanced restraint system that combines attributes of safety belt and airbag technologies. It is designed to reduce head, neck and chest injuries for rear seat passengers in frontal crashes by distributing crash force energy across five times more of an occupant\u2019s torso than a traditional safety belt. Inflatable belts are available for second-row outboard seating positions The all-new Edge will be available in four trim levels. These include SE, SEL, Sport and \u2013 for the first time \u2013 a top-of-the-line Titanium series to meet market demand for more premium offerings. Overall, the Edge represents a significant move forward in both material and visual quality. Throughout the vehicle, seams are tighter and more consistent, and the design has been executed in a way that reduces visual cutlines. The team worked out the smallest of details, such as rethinking how the front doors meet the instrument panel, simplifying merging points and reducing potential alignment issues."}

I am proposing to open an Education Center with the main focus of helping children in their home with their homework after school. I understand there are mixed emotions regarding private tutoring among Doha's families, however I believe the negativities are propagated by unlicensed/uncertified tutors. The proposed facility will not only employ certified tutors with screened credentials, but they will also have passed an international background check from their country of origin. If your child needs help with their French homework you will have a certified, pre-screened tutor from France, one that works for an agency that is conducting business here legally under the strict guidelines of the Ministry of Education. If your child needs help with English, English will be the tutors native language etc... This would require a large undertaking, one that is solely based for the community and for the future of Qatar. The children we see running through the malls, or crying in a stroller may be bothersome to most, but these are our future leaders. It is our responsibility to nurture their curiosity and help them grow into productive members of society. Without knowledge all of our futures are bleak... (I am sure there are numerous grammatical errors in my post, however pointing them out does nothing but derail the important message behind it. So please let's try to keep the replies to the matter at hand.) Here are my questions for you, the community of Qatar. I would like to hear from both families (foreign & domestic) and teachers alike. 1: What are your thoughts of a legally sanctioned (by the SEC) center with the primary focus of after school home tutoring? 2: Would you prefer to have home 1 on 1 tutoring for your child or would you prefer a group setting not to exceed 4 students at the Education Center? 3: Teachers, your contract permitting, would you be interested in being part of the center to help the youth of Qatar? I know some of you already tutor in your free time, however what I'm offering is an avenue for you to continue to do so legally, without the worry of penalty and deportation. I will leave it there for now in hopes this stirs up a lengthy conversation, I would prefer if no punches were pulled. I am eager to hear you responses, positive OR negative. Thank you for your time."}

The girl - known only as Derya B - gave birth in a village in the Mutki district of Turkey last week. However, after the child was born, the girl was rushed to hospital complaining of headaches and nausea. She was then rushed to intensive care after doctors said she had suffered from a brain haemorrhage but she died on Thursday. It is thought the brain haemorrhage could have been caused by her giving birth at an early age. Prosecutors have now launched an investigation into her death and are speaking to her family and husband."}

Thanks for the feedback...I'm leaning toward the LWB 3.5, mainly due to lower cost, and due to the fact that I'll hit the dunes no more than a handful of times a year...and even then mainly to the beach in places like fuwairit and sealine :-D", "commentId": "comment-7409621"}, {"username": "Dracu", "comment": "I rent a 3.5 for about 6 months.

I'm looking to buy a second car, mainly to use as my daily commuter, but something capable of a little offroading. I think Pajero is good value for money, but I really dont need all the bells&whistles that come in the full package (and drive the cost up). If I could get a 3.8 with nothing else I would, but I dont want to pay an extra 30-40k for stuff I dont want (sunroof, rear camera, sound system etc). I would even go for the 3 door, but somehow that ends up being more expensive than the basic 5 door, because 3 door only comes in full package... So I'm considering the 3.5 engine basic model with no frills, but I want to know how capable is it on sand ? I dont care how it feels on the road/highway, I already have a comfortable city suv. And for offroading I'm not interested in doing crazy dune bashing, dont want to go up steep slopes, but at the very least I want to be able to go on gently sloping sand without worrying about getting stuck or overheating the engine, tranmission, anything else... So is the 3.5 good enough for this? I've heard a lot that driving on sand is all about technique (and reducing tire pressure), do I really need a 3.8 for what I plan to use it for ? Followup question, should i bother do something to improve ground clearance, or is it OK as-is ?"}

HIV has claimed millions of lives and destroyed families...", "commentId": "comment-7405121"}], "question": "What is HIV?  HIV is the name given to a virus that attacks the natural immune system of the body. HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Both the virus and the infection it causes are known as HIV.\u00a0 HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). HIV alters the body\u2019s immune system making people much more vulnerable to infections and diseases.  There is currently no available treatment for HIV/AIDS. Doctors prescribe a combination of medicines known as \u201ccocktails.\u201d The cocktails strengthen the immune system to keep HIV symptoms from developing into AIDS or to relieve AIDS symptoms. The cocktails are often very costly. They have serious side effects. Also, they may work for a limited period of time.  The difficulty with treating HIV is that it hides in dormant cells that the human immune system cannot get to. However, it now appears that scientist may have made an incredible breakthrough. A clinical trial of a new HIV treatment in the UK is showing no signs of the virus in the blood of the first 50 patients to complete the trials. While this discovery is promising, it is far too early to say the virus has been cured just yet. This is because the virus could return.\u00a0\u00a0  The trial is being conducted by five British universities in collaboration with the UK\u2019s National Health Service. These parties believe they are on the verge of defeating HIV once and for all. While the trial is still in its infancy, the progress that has been made to date is truly remarkable. The treatment being used in the clinical trial is the first that aims at destroying the HIV in every part of the body.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The treatment combines a drug that reactivates dormant cells that contain HIV with a vaccine that\u2019s designed to help the immune system to locate and kill them. The vaccine is the first part of the treatment administered to patients, waking up the dormant cells, followed by a drug called \u201cVorinostat\u201d which allows the immune system to finish them off.  Current antiretroviral drugs are effective at stopping HIV in its tracks. However, no treatment that kills off the virus altogether has been discovered to date.  This new treatment, therefore, has the hope of millions of people around the globe riding on it."}

It\u2019s just faster, and easier. 3.

It also helps you navigate, monitor and avoid congested roads. Definitely, a must have app to stay ahead of traffic conditions in Qatar. 4. Waze Waze is a pretty interesting app because it lets you communicate with other drivers who are in and around the same area as you. Much easier to get real time traffic information. You can also contribute real time traffic information and actively report police traps, accidents, hidden cameras and other hazards. 5. Offline Maps & Navigation For all those prepaid users, who always run out of data, Offline Maps is a life saver.

I went with my friend to a restaurant in The Pearl and it was kind of crowded. The waitress took us to a table where a Qatari couple were dining right across us. My friend and I quickly agreed to request another table because we knew sitting in front of them could make them feel uncomfortable while there were other empty tables. However, in a situation where there are no other available tables, we would not give up the table but would still be considerate enough to change our seats. We will make sure that our backs face the female partrons so she feels totally comfortable and her privacy is maintained. It is unfortunate that there are restaurants in Doha today that do not have appropriate spaces for customer privacy. While I'm surprised that we still have unspoken codes of ethics in our culture, I like them and they remind us of respecting others privacy. : As a Muslim non-local female, often if I'm dining with my family, we will see Qatari males get up and change their seats if I am seated within their vision. It's like clock-work, if I am already seated and they are entering they will always ask the waiter to seat them far away from me or ensure they sit next to each other (side by side) and I am out of view."}

Drive Sensibly Aggressive driving (speeding, rapid acceleration and braking) wastes Oil /Fuel. It can lower your Oil /Fuel mileage by 33% at highway speeds and by 5% around town. Sensible driving is also safer for you and others, so you may save more than Oil /Fuel money.1 Driver feedback devices can help you drive more efficiently. A recent study suggests that they can help the average driver improve fuel economy by about 3% and that those using them to save fuel can improve Oil /Fuel mileage by about 10%.2 2. Observe the Speed Limit While each vehicle reaches its optimal fuel economy at a different speed (or range of speeds), Oil /Fuel mileage usually decreases rapidly at speeds above 50 mph. You can assume that each 5 mph you drive over 50 mph is like paying an additional QR 0.4 per liter for Oil /Fuel. Observing the speed limit is also safer 3. Avoid Hauling Cargo on Your Roof Hauling cargo on your roof increases aerodynamic drag (wind resistance) and lowers fuel economy. A large, blunt roof-top cargo box, for example, can reduce fuel economy by around 2% to 8% in city driving, 6% to 17% on the highway, and 10% to 25% at Interstate speeds (65 mph to 75 mph).4 Rear-mount cargo boxes or trays reduce fuel economy by much less\u2014only 1% or 2% in city driving and 1% to 5% on the highway. If you need to use an external cargo container, removing it when it's not in use will save fuel and money. 4. Remove Excess Weight Avoid keeping unnecessary items in your vehicle, especially heavy ones. An extra 100 pounds in your vehicle could reduce your MPG by about 1%.The reduction is based on the percentage of extra weight relative to the vehicle's weight and affects smaller vehicles more than larger ones. 5. Avoid Excessive Idling Idling can use a quarter to a half gallon of fuel per hour, depending on engine size and air conditioner (AC) use. Turn off your engine when your vehicle is parked. It only takes about 10 second\u2019s worth of fuel to restart your vehicle. 6.

While the prices have not seen dramatic highs or lows, things could change once the global oil glut dies down. With a little care, you can optimise the amount of fuel your car uses. And in the long run, it can definitely help you save a few riyals here and there. has collected some tips as to how to minimise fuel consumption. Do you have more suggestions? Let us know in the comment section and we\u2019ll add it to this. \u00a0 While this is a tough one to follow in Doha, a little bit of planning can help you save much on fuel costs. Travelling in traffic jams is an expensive way to move. Each time you stop and start again, the car needs to do so in first and second gears. Both these gears are huge fuel guzzlers. In addition, you can also save fuel by understanding the traffic ahead and travelling steadily at a slow speed, rather than accelerating and braking. \u00a0 While it\u2019s not a problem while driving in town, the shape of your car becomes very important when you\u2019re moving more quickly, on a motorway for example. The car\u2019s sleek aerodynamics helps reduce the \u2018drag\u2019 on it while travelling at high speeds. While you cannot do much about your car\u2019s design, you can avoid making things worse by keeping the windows and sunroof closed. \u00a0 While not a very common sight in Qatar, some cars do have mammoth roof racks/ski boxes installed. Removing them will help you save a lot. This is because even if the roof rack is empty, it increases drag and makes your car consume much more fuel than necessary. Even if you need them, go for ones that can be easily attached and detached. Remove after use. \u00a0 This is simple science. The heavier your car is, the more fuel you will use to get it to move. Don\u2019t carry stuff around in the boot of your car unless you need it. You may prefer to leave heavy items in the boot rather than remove them (owing to laziness), but it will only help burn a hole in your pocket. \u00a0 What is the ideal speed to travel for maximum fuel efficiency? Experts say it is about 80kmph. If you\u2019re a patient driver, your fuel bills will be that much lower. While it\u2019s impossible to not overtake at some point of time, resisting the urge to constantly accelerate (simply to get in front of the car ahead) will reflect significantly on your fuel bill. \u00a0 Don\u2019t believe the hype. The maximum time you can save on a 300km highway trip, if you travel at 130kmph instead of 110kmph, is just 20 minutes. But the amount of petrol a car uses up to save you 20 minutes is insane. Don\u2019t do it unless you\u2019re in a big hurry and every minute counts. \u00a0 This is really a no-brainer. Maintaining optimum pressure on your tyres is important not only to save fuel, but also to keep you safe. The lower the tyre pressure, the more fuel the car needs to move it along. It will be wise to check your tyre pressure every fortnight, or at least once a month at the minimum. \u00a0 You can avoid wasting fuel by not tailgating. In such instances, you'll often press the gas to regain the speed lost from braking, which forces you to correct your following distance by applying your brakes, causing a vicious cycle. This constant up and down uses up more fuel than ever. Repeated braking wastes energy. It gets converted into unnecessary heat energy and greatly reduces the service life of your brakes. \u00a0 This again is simple science \u2014 a lighter car uses lesser fuel. What makes your car lighter? Not having a full tank. When you hit that 1/3 mark and are tempted to fill up, give it a couple of days. That last 1/3 may last you a bit longer than the first third. \u00a0 If you idle your car for more than a minute, it\u2019ll save gas to turn off the engine. Also, new cars do not need to be \u2018warmed up\u2019 on a cold winter day \u2014 a few seconds should do the trick. Whenever you're waiting for someone, turn off the idle. Drive thru diner or going inside? Going inside, definitely. All saves gas. \u00a0 Sure, when we cut the engine, everything goes off. But what about when we start it back up? If you turn everything off, the next time you start up your car, it'll take way less gas to get everything going. \u00a0 When manufacturers set definite time frames to maintain your car, they do it for a reason. Keeping your car regularly serviced will help save fuel. Changing spark plugs and wires on schedule helps keep fuel wastage at a minimum. The better your engine runs, the more power it\u2019ll produce on lesser fuel. \u00a0 This may sound surprising, but higher-octane petrol may not always be the best suit for your car. Don\u2019t buy it unless your vehicle requires it. Octane has nothing to do with gasoline performance. It merely indicates the volatility factor in the combustion chamber. Unless your vehicle owner\u2019s manual specifically requires it, don\u2019t use premium fuel. It works out much cheaper in the long run.\u00a0"}

Secondly a lot of my stuff came either partially or fully damaged due to carelessness and improper handling knowing that I was convinced by their agent to go for the sea transportation option instead of the road to avoid the improper handling at KSA borders.

A problem shared is a problem solved ............", "commentId": "comment-7399356"}], "question": "As young adults we keep perceiving our friends according to our past experiences as kids or teenagers. We misunderstand, get in conflict and we forgive ourselves or redeem our mistakes by coming up with excuses or justifications as to why the friendship has ended. Here are some tips that I have learned from my own personal friendships. \u00a0Some have lasted 5 to 12 years and these are the reasons I believe why. 1 - Appreciate  Many of our friends try to address our issues and confront us. I used to prefer to avoid addressing issues. I would also feel bullied when issues were confronted by friends. The reality is my friends were trying to push me to overcome certain situations or sensitivities. If you refuse to change a certain trait, that \u00a0is fine, but I would omit \u00a0thinking that you're bullied. Make sure you appreciate the given feedback and work on it or just move on. True friends would still stand by you. Also, appreciate the small things; whether it\u2019s invites to dinner plans, field trips (even if you don\u2019t like visiting the places), or invites to special moments. \u00a0People chose to include you and wanted your company, so that is something nice to appreciate. 2 - Your problems are not shared If you commit a mistake by doing or saying the wrong thing, then just apologize immediately. \u201cI'm sorry\u201d is a very powerful and humble thing to say. True friends would get over it in a day or two. If he/she doesn't, then it is his/her problem not yours as well. 3 - Give feedback Talk about what was cool and not so cool. Your friends are not mind readers and they're only humans. \u00a0So forget and repeat the unpleasant things that you prefer not discussing or doing. 4 - Whatever you do, do not assume! I would stress this the most. It is one of my worst traits that I try to change. Do not assume something and share that assumption. Too often, it would hurt your friends. Instead, ask questions! Do not let your imagination run wild because you are no longer stranger from that classroom, office, or street. 5 - Mutual Privacy You should respect your friends\u2019 privacy. No matter how close you are. Even if it reaches that level where people think that the two of you are as thick as thieves, a level of privacy should always mutually respected. I'm so thankful to all for all of my friends and you should be of all of yours!"}

It would drain Isis\u2019s coffers and reimburse the US for the costs of its military commitments in the Middle East, the candidate insists. At a forum hosted by NBC on 7 September, Trump suggested oil seizure would have been a way to pay for the Iraq war, saying: \u201cWe go in, we spend $3tn, we lose thousands and thousands of lives, and then \u2026 what happens is we get nothing. You know, it used to be to the victor belong the spoils.\u201d He added: \u201cOne of the benefits we would have had if we took the oil is Isis would not have been able to take oil and use that oil to fuel themselves.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not stealing anything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re reimbursing ourselves \u2026 at a minimum, and I say more. We\u2019re taking back $1.5tn to reimburse ourselves.\u201d As a security strategy, this presents huge problems from almost every angle, according to military, strategic, legal and oil experts. First of all, there are issues of principle and legality. Trump\u2019s frequent invocation of the \u201cspoils of war\u201d seems to hark back to a bygone age of conquistadors and plunder-based imperialism, illegal now under the laws of war. \u201cIn international law, you can\u2019t take civilian goods or seize them. That would amount to a war crime,\u201d Anthony Cordesman, the Arleigh Burke chair in strategy at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cOil exports were almost the only Iraqi source of money. So you would have to pay for government salaries, maintain the army, and you have triggered a level of national animosity far worse than we did. It would be the worst kind of neo-colonialism. Not even Britain did that.\u201d Jay Hakes, the author of A Declaration of Energy Independence, about the relationship between US national security and Middle Eastern oil, was similarly unsparing. \u201cIt is hard to overstate the stupidity of this idea,\u201d he wrote on Real Clear Energy. \u201cEven our allies in the Middle East regard oil in their lands as a gift from God and the only major source of income to develop their countries. Seizing Iraq\u2019s oil would make our current allies against Isis our new enemies. We would likely, at the least, have to return to the massive military expenditures and deployment of American troops at the war\u2019s peak.\u201d \u00a0"}

Let's be honest - such events don't normally take place in Qatar. In a country full of expats from different backgrounds who often just hang out in their own circles, this was a great way to connect the community with local businesses through their common love of burgers. The idea that so many top brands, including Burger King, Chili's, Crepaway and so many more, would come together to give away free burgers whenever a burger is purchased in the same month as Eid, was awesome, so kudos to Urban Point and Qatar Living for pulling off such an original and unique event.  (By the way: Burger Month is still on-going until the end of September, so there is still time to participate!! :-D) Now, as a burger lover, I made it a personal mission to try out as many places as possible this month.  So far, I've tried burgers at Roger's Diner, Urban Jazz Kitchen, Burger King, Chili's, Fouj Cafe, Cioccoitalianni, Burger Gourmet, Elevation Burger, The Atelier Art Cafe and Johnny Rockets! And there's still so more to try before this month is over! Personally, I felt that Fouj Cafe meat patty was the juiciest, while Roger's Diner had the softest Bun and Elevation Burger had overall satisfying burgers, since they use organic ingredients, for when I'm on the run.  Although it's crazy how much meat I've consumed this month, I still want to try Black Rock Grill and Diner's Station up at the Pearl and will try to squeeze in the remaining participating brands; namely, Lord of the Wings, Johnny Rockets, Crepaway, Gioia, Chocolate Bar, Patagonia, and Al Kut Cafe in Wyndham. Pfew.  After this month, I'll need to check my cholesterol and maybe stick to salads for October ... LOL. Title Picture: \u00a0From Burger Gourmet"}

In 2015, he attracted widespread outrage after posting photos of the dog wearing two Apple Watches with luxury bands worth upwards of $37,000. Most of his online posts are infamous as outrageous displays of wealth, for which he has come under fire from Chinese state media. The official\u00a0 news agency published a blistering commentary about Wang accusing him of having \u201cstained the purity of the Chinese (people)\u201d and warning others not to copy the \u201carrogant and coarse celebrity\u201d with \u201cBerlusconi-style arrogance.\u201d This forced Wang\u2019s father to appear to on state television in connection with\u00a0the controversy.

Being a personal fan of the Shangri La brand, I thought it was due time to finally check out the one that opened in Qatar - I know, it's a little late. \u00a0But so many places and so little time! The one surprising factor about the place is that it has a very calming presence. \u00a0Everything is a bit more dimly lit, it's not going for an ultra modern chic look, that many of the West Bay hotels offer. \u00a0 It almost feels like a bit of the far east was transferred into the Doha... with a bit of Qatari flare, that is.  As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by warm soft tones and a real live falcon. \u00a0No joke. \u00a0She was beautiful. \u00a0The staff kindly referred to her as \"their colleague\".  The Chi spa was all sort of awesomeoness. \u00a0Again, it was different than most the ones you find in Doha. \u00a0Everything was dimly lit, dark wood everywhere, and they used the most amazingly fragranced products ever. \u00a0 They also serve a lovely complimentary peppermint tea.\u00a0 The staff were super friendly as well. \u00a0Post treatment I was ready to call it a day, but then I saw sign for exquisite pastries. \u00a0Thus, I made my way to their Lobby Lounge. \u00a0Thank goodness for that sign! The Lobby Lounge offers an amazingly relaxing environment with live piano, amazing desserts and dim sum platter for two that is only 100QR! They have some exciting desserts and I sampled their fusion Baklava Cheesecake. \u00a0I was expecting some sort of lame excuse for cheesecake, as can happen in Doha. \u00a0But this was actually good, and it maintained a \"baklava\" essence. \u00a0It was served with cinnamon syrup and it was delicious. \u00a0 For those seeking a relaxing environment to escape the hustle and bustle of the city, the Shangri La Doha might be your place :)"}

You\u2019ll forget humidity exists and need to reapply your deodorant more frequently. Here is your exclusive guide on what to do starting from the airport all the way until you can finally call Qatar home. Visa on arrival: GCC nationals/residents, and expats all you will need is your passport. In advance visas: Print out your visa and carry it on you. It saves you time if you end up in a long immigration line. If you\u2019ve upgraded to fully assimilating into Qatari culture, your residency will be your Qatari ID. Make sure you bring it. *Disclaimer: Unfortunately, you\u2019re flying in at a season where Qatar is being repopulated. Chances are you will be waiting in the longest line ever at the airport. Find the \u201cOther nationality\u201d section, let the man in the military outfit usher you, and you will be fine. Families, GCC Nationals, and diplomats, you\u2019re in luck. Transportation Karwa: Qatar\u2019s national transportation company provides taxi services, public transportation, and its latest addition, the Karwa taxi application you can find  .\u00a0 : On demand app based taxi service. All you need to do is download the application from the Apple store for iOS or Google Play for Android users. If you already have it, just order a ride : This is a newer on demand app for your personalized transportation needs in Qatar. It\u2019s gaining popularity in Doha and is a home-grown alternative to Uber. Private limousines/taxi companies: You would need some good recommendations. Stick to the bigger companies, until you make some new friends and bond over the humidity. For directions, Google Maps is a good reliable source in the beginning, but don\u2019t be surprised if some of the routes are inaccurate. Try to figure out the major roads and areas and if all fails, have faith in humanity Apartments: For those who need to find a place on a more permanent basis  Hotels: When you first get here, you may want to go with a short term accomodation option at one of the  .\u00a0 Airbnb:  , and be able to reserve a short term apartment.

Its allure and charm extends to the malls to the museums and out to the sand dunes. \u00a0There is a lot more to explore out in the sand and sun of this vast land. First impressions are the last, so make the most of your experience while you are visiting Qatar. Here are 9 fantastic places and things every tourist must experience to get the authentic taste of Qatar. The truth is out there! Just head over to the dunes surrounding Qatar and discover for yourself what mysteries they hold in their rugged terrain. Dune bashing is a must-have exhilarating experience that will leave the flavor of Qatar embedded in your mind forever. Another absolute must is a trip to the beautiful Corniche cascading along a palm-dotted stretch of the boulevard in Qatar. Your eyes will be pleased with the visual treat of Dhows bobbing peacefully over the water at regular intervals along the Corniche, beckoning you to sail in them. There is a track running the whole length of the Corniche for joggers, runners, or for just casual walking. Take in the scenery and breathe in your surroundings. With the water on one side, overlooking the Museum of Islamic Art and the iconic Fanar, and West Bay cityscape on the other side, your walk will be nothing short of a marvel; every time. A visit to the most beautiful museum in Qatar is a definite go-to place in your itinerary list. A history enthusiast or not, you will enjoy everything MIA has to offer. Its ambience is luxurious and elegant, imbued with a sense of knowledge and culture within its walls. Take your time to explore each floor and learn more about the history of the rich culture of Qatar and Islamic traditions. Mathaf houses the largest collection of Arab art, both modern and contemporary. Mark it on your list to visit and prepare to be amazed by all forms of art. It is bound to pique your curiosity and make you wonder over the multifaceted themes artists have poured their hearts and souls into. Qatar boasts of a number of beautiful beaches, all with their distinctive features. Some beaches are mellower and safer for families to take their little kids to. Other beaches have waves roaring in and retreating with a crescendo that is exciting to witness. South of Qatar lies the Inland Sea, also known as Khor Al Adaid. It is a popular tourist attraction for visitors. Arrange a four wheel vehicle to navigate you there, and go in groups as it is an uninhabited area far from the city. With its versatile terrain and flora and fauna, don\u2019t be surprised to see turtles and gazelles on your way. A fascinating installation of art is mounted in the middle of the desert, called East-West/West-East by artist Richard Serra. Be sure to include the extraordinary artwork in your to-do list. Serra believes art has its place on the street. As it is with art, the interpretation is up to the viewer. Ponder over the huge installations in the desert and let your imagination run wild. Yes, sand dunes of Qatar actually sing to you! Take the time out to visit them, sit with them and try to decipher the message they are singing out. Or better yet, just listen to the singing dunes and enjoy! Just 40km from Doha the desert is shaped naturally in this fascinating phenomenon. Wind blowing through the sand dunes creates low-pitched whistling sounds that change their hum and volume according to the speed of the wind. Horse racing? Check. Camel racing? What? There are some things you can enjoy only in Qatar, and what better way to spend your time than to witness an exciting race of camels on the racetrack! Enroute to Dukhan city from Doha lies the Al Shahaniya Camel Racetrack. Check for the racing schedule before planning to watch this spectacular event. Even if racing is not scheduled you can watch the camels in training. Get a taste of history hands-on outside of museums in Qatar. Return to the days of yore by observing rock carvings dating to the fifteenth century in the northwest region of Qatar. The rock carvings appear on the limestone hills and show geometric patterns, and shapes of animals and ships. Some relics of pottery and domestic utensils are also found along with these petroglyphs. Last but not the least, here is bonus number 10 to enjoy a truly remarkable experience in Qatar. Treat your adventurous souls with a kayaking experience among the sprawing mangroves at Al Thakhira. Discover Arabia \u2013 Entalek offers various kayaking packages with barbecue. Packages include sunset, sunrise and moonlight kayaking for an unforgettable experience paddling among water and watching the ownders of nature . Al Thakhira coast stretches across the beach on the northern side Al Khor Corniche. The defining features of Al Thakhira are mangroves and varieties of birds. The mangroves provide an experience of oasis in the middle of the desert. \u00a0"}

Its reputation is in tatters. And even its top executive is talking about whether the automaker will survive. Mitsubishi Motors\u2019 future is hanging in the balance for the second time in a decade after a bombshell admission that it has been cheating on fuel-economy tests for years. The crisis is threatening to put the company into the ditch permanently, but some analysts think the vast web of shareholdings among Japanese firms may just save it from the scrap yard. \u201cI really think the future of Mitsubishi Motors is grim,\u201d said Hideyuki Kobayashi, a business professor at Hitotsubashi University, who authored a book about the company\u2019s struggles with an earlier cover-up. \u201cIt would be silly to buy a Mitsubishi car after this (scandal). This isn\u2019t the \ufb01rst time this has happened.\u201d In 2005, the maker of the Outlander SUV and Lancer cars was pulled back from the brink of bankruptcy after it was discovered that it covered up vehicle defects that caused fatal accidents. The vast Mitsubishi group of companies stepped in with a series of bailouts, saving the embattled \ufb01rm. But it is not clear if they would be so willing to help this time around as the automaker faces possibly huge \ufb01nes, lawsuits and customer compensation costs. This week, Mitsubishi admitted its faulty testing stretches back a quarter century, longer than \ufb01rst thought, so the odds that cars sold overseas were involved has soared\u2014along with the potential scope of the crisis. Unnamed employees also falsi\ufb01ed data to make cars look more fuel efficient than they were, it has said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the full picture yet on how the company would compensate\u201d customers, said Seiji Sugiura, a senior auto analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute. \u201cAll Mitsubishi cars on the road right now could be subject to compensation costs, which would be massive.\u201d Sales in Japan have dived by nearly half since the scandal broke last week, and the damage to its reputation threatens to hammer its \ufb01nances. But \u201cthe Mitsubishi brand remains strong in foreign markets, especially in Thailand which has been a signi\ufb01cant source of pro\ufb01t for the company. There is also a new factory in Indonesia\u201d, Sugiura said. \u201cThere is foundation to build a recovery if the company doesn\u2019t get entangled in wrongdoing overseas.\u201d A desperate Mitsubishi may also embrace a foreign suitor if top shareholders abandon it."}

However, there is much more than meets the eye in Qatar, or as Shakespeare aptly put,\u00a0'There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.' A quiet strength encapsulates Qatar,\u00a0embodying great resilience, fortitude and a calm embrace for travelers in its land. Here are a few wonders of Qatar, old and new, that hold a fascination for all, dwellers as well as tourists. If you have not yet ventured into this house of fascinating collectibles, you are missing out on a gem in Qatar. It lies at a distance of 20km from Education City going on the Dukhan Highway. A trip to the museum four years ago greeted us with surprise elements, in the form of historic remains of Qatar, coupled with boats, vehicles throughout the ages, as well as a plane! A recent trip proved just as entertaining, however, we noticed that the arrangement of the collections had changed and new items had been added. One can only marvel at the range of interests that are gathered under one roof. Sheikh Faisal had remarkable taste in everything. \u00a0 The Msheireb Museums presented us with a pleasant surprise recently, making us wonder how we could have missed it before. The museum is comprised of four houses, each built as the exact replica of the original one built in the exact area about a century and a half ago. Each house showcases the history of Qatar. Among the four houses, the Company House exhibits how Qatar developed after the discovery of oil in the region. The other house, Bait Radwani displays the life lived in the Qatari home the days of yore. Bin Jelmood House offered the most poignant journey in Qatar\u2019s life, related to slavery throughout the years. It was far from the preconceived notions of slavery, and showed how the master and the helper lived side by side; sometimes it was indiscernible to distinguish which was whom among the two. \u00a0 Enroute to Dukhan city from Doha lies the Al Shahaniya Camel Racetrack. Check for the racing schedule before planning to watch this spectacular event. Even if racing is not scheduled you can watch the camels in training. Get up close and personal with these desert ships, when they are walking to the track. Some trainers allow you to pet the camels, which is an exciting prospect for children. Ever heard the wind howling at an unusual pitch outside your building? This phenomenon occurs because of certain angles of physical structures where wind flows with speed, and can vary from whistling to high pitched scary howling. Just 40km from Doha the desert is shaped naturally in this fascinating phenomenon. Wind blowing through the sand dunes creates low-pitched whistling sounds that change their hum and volume according to the speed of the wind. \u00a0 On the North of Doha some ruins can be found among which Umm Salal Fort stands out the most. The structure has stood from the eighteenth century and maintains its glory in the desert. Just ahead of the Umm Salal Mohammed Fort another historic structure can be seen. The Barzan Towers were created at the beginning of the 20th century, as a watchtower to monitor incoming travelers, to watch over the pearl diving, and also functioned as a lighthouse and moon observatory to track important occasions in the Hijri calendar. One tower has an impressive staircase worth inspecting as a marvelous architectural piece in the region\u2019s history. Built in 1938, the Zubara Fort stands as a formidable building alone in the middle of the desert on the west coast of Qatar. It was used for military purposes back in the day, but stands as an abandoned architectural marvel today that has been preserved through the harsh climate of Qatar. In the northwest region of Qatar there are relics from the ancient past that reflect the life of dwellers from the fifteenth century. The rock carvings appear on the limestone hills and show geometric patterns, and shapes of animals and ships. Some relics of pottery and domestic utensils are also found along with these petroglyphs. Just at the end of the Al Khor Corniche on the northern side, Al Thakhira coast stretches across the beach. The defining features of Al Thakhira are mangroves and varieties of birds. The mangroves provide an experience of oasis in the middle of the desert. For the more adventurous souls, kayaking experiences are available through an eco-adventure company. The Zekreet village in north-western region of Qatar offers several attractions, including the Zekreet Beach, Zekreet Fort and Film City. The Zekreet Fort is similar to Zubara Fort in architectural design and materials used. The four watchtowers were constructed at a later date than the original structure. Another place worth visiting at Zekreet is the Film City. It is a recently built structure replicating a small Arabic city with minarets and lined with palm trees. Like other ruins it is abandoned, but an interesting sight to behold nevertheless; the new with the old in the history of Qatar."}

Possibly, your wild act could have been overlooked if you had spared mentioning that person's name in your post. But then by mentioning his name in \"capital letters\" in your post speaks much about your qualities and thinking. You demanded some action be taken on a person who was carrying out his responsibilities dutifully. Surely, it was not an incident of such great importance that it should have been highlighted at a social media website. Try being in the boots of the person who was at the petrol station in heat and humidity trying his best to to meet the demands of customers waiting in line. He was the one who was following the system and the rules.

One of the main reasons is the bottle neck entrance where the Heavy vehicles and small vehicles hardly go together at once. Secondly, noticed majority of the vehicles fuel filling is at the left side. This also another reason for the long waiting and delay. When inside Doha, at any fuel station, any vehicle can fill gas regardles the left side or right side fuel inlets.\u00a0 My car have fuel inlet at the left. When I took my car on the opposite sided pump, the filling person denied to fill petrol and said you have to come on the other track... After some debate, I had to take a long way back to catch up the long queue to get my fuel. Indeed my car is a small two seater..!! This may be the ignorance of the person or his attittude or laziness. But, this is the main reason the long queue at the industrial area road and delays...

I had already started online research before moving here, and I must say, to every query I googled, I got an answer from this very website. Qatar Living has been a pivotal part of helping me ease my way into Doha. After moving here I saw that my home required finishing touches for its comfort and d\u00e9cor (I had brought furniture with me).

Within two days of my search, I had found just the right cabinets for my kitchen and laundry, along with a few other knick knacks that the seller was advertising. This was easy! After the instant hit, I was on a roll. The next thing I looked up was a face cream that is available only in Korea. I struck gold again! As soon as I entered its name along with Qatar, a Qatar Living link came up with the precise product I wanted. I contacted the seller and she replied promptly. We met the next day and the deal was done effortlessly. Being the choosey buyer I am, I started exploring more options on how to find the best of everything in Doha. I stumbled upon the Qatar Living  . I can say with all honesty that my queries and doubts were all answered by the helpful replies. They made me feel at home. I realized that there are lots of places and events in Qatar that go unnoticed, but regular perusal of Qatar Living opened up a world of possibilities.

Either way, there are quite a few things you need to keep in mind while buying a used vehicle because it is far trickier than choosing a new vehicle. Several expats usually leave the country during the summer and put their vehicles up for sale. This would be the perfect time to look around for a used car as you could take advantage of panicked sellers who are planning to travel immediately. There are a number of factors to consider and getting the right valuation is not quite straightforward. Here are a few things to keep in mind while buying a used car in Qatar. Make sure you set up a meeting to check out the car during the day and not in the evenights. You will probably see any dents or scratches better during the day. This will also be a great time to test the air-condition of the car, a very important feature if you are driving in Qatar, where summers can be extremely hot. Make sure the car has a sound air-condition or you will be kicking yourself later. Take the cars you like for a test drive. If you're an experienced driver, you will be able to detect any obvious problems. Pay more attention to suspension, ease of driving, noises from the engine, steering, brakes and gears. You're probably going to be the owner of this car, so feel free to drive it fast (obviously not at crazy high speeds), make quick turns and go over speed breakers. It will be added advantage if you can test drive on roads you know well. It is important that you feel good about the car before you take it forward any further. You may also consider taking a friend with you during the test drive for a second opinion. This is the decisive part of your second-hand car purchase. The inspection will and should decide whether you should get this car. You can take the car to any of the vehicle inspectors located on Salwa Road for advanced checks that may have skipped your attention. They will test the car for engine performance, chassis strength, transmission wear and tear, body paint irregularities and other major technicalities. They will give you an estimate of how much you will end up spending if you bought that car. If you get a positive report, you may consider buying the vehicle. Once you've established that everything is to your satisfaction, negotiate a deal. Be confident of the price of the car when bargaining with the owner or dealership. Negotiate hard for a discount, but do have an idea about a fair price that you are willing to pay. However, if the dealer volunteers a discount that is too good to be true, then double check the car. If you feel that something is wrong with the deal, do not hesitate to withdraw from the deal. To be sure, you can ask for a accident history from the Traffic department or the car manufacturer (if you have the car's chassis number). If the car sustained mechanical damages during the accident, you better withdraw from the deal right away. Once you have made up your mind on the car you want to buy, head over to the Traffic department in Madinat Khalifa South (open till 7pm normally) along with the car owner. Carry your driving license or Residency Card with you. Pay QR 200 with your debit/credit card to change the car registration to your name. Now the car legally belongs to you. This process can also be done hassle-free using the Metrash2 app if the seller is a registered user. Once the ownership has been changed online, you can visit the Traffic Department and collect your new car redgistration card by presenting your Residency Card and the old car redgistration. If the car has a valid registration, then car also has a valid insurance. You may change your insurance agent at the end of the term if you wish. Most of the time, online car shoppers complete their buying process without a hiccup. However, there are\u00a0scammers and crooks here working hard to get your money. There are some scammers on Qatar Living too so always be alert. Here are some tips to avoid online scams and fraudsters: -\u00a0If a deal seems too good to be true, you need to be careful. If someone's selling a brand-new Toyota Camry for QAR60,000 then it's a scam because the retail price is twice as much. - Never negotiate a deal online.\u00a0Set up a meeting with the seller to check out the car yourself. If they don't have the car in their possession, it could be a scam. - Never share your personal or financial information online (address, credit card details, pin numbers etc) - If a seller asks you to pay via\u00a0Western Union or MoneyGram or directs you to send your payment to an individual, chances are very high that it's a scam. Look for a car with low mileage Look for a car with a longer registration validity (This means his car was recently insured) Make sure the car had no major accidents Check if any major car parts are replaced with fake parts Check the trunk for any missing tools or spare tire Check all electricals: lights, headlights, power windows, stereo etc Do a thorough test drive on highways and inside the neighbourhood Did we miss anything? Let us know and we will add it to our list. Was this information useful?"}

{"subject": "It's game time for MotoGP as the 2016 season kicks off.", "username": "Nairi", "topic": "welcome-qatar", "question": "A new season begins for the MotoGP World Championship as the league undergoes radical technical changes. New Michelin tyres, revised fuel limits, a spec ECU and unified software have already shaken up the grid during the season test. Valentino Rossi, Jorge Lorenzo, Marc Marquez and Dani Pedrosa gathered together for the traditional pre-race press conference. They were joined by rising stars Andrea Iannone and Maverick Vi\u00f1ales, both out to assert themselves as MotoGP aliens and contenders for victory in 2016. Reigning MotoGP World Champion Jorge Lorenzo (Movistar Yamaha MotoGP), opened the press conference: \u201cNot a lot of things change from the outside where the people can see the bikes. For the riders, it\u2019s really a big difference. Firstly with the tyres, the Michelins offer a completely different feeling on the bike and also with the new electronics, the same for everyone, are less sophisticated and much more difficult to ride and control, especially with the throttle. Anyway the pre-season has been very very good, better than we expected. In the three tests we did, we got a good feeling and did some impressive lap times.\u201d After winning the Commercial Bank Grand Prix of Qatar in 2015, Valentino Rossi (Movistar Yamaha MotoGP) produced one of the best seasons of his career, missing the podium in just three races. It was a season full of epic battles and incredible comebacks and \u2018The Doctor\u2019 is ready for another exciting year: \u201cThis year everything will be very interesting as we have a lot of differences, especially about riding the motorcycle. We changed things that make a big difference, the tyres are different and also the electronic system is a little more basic. During the winter season we saw a lot of riders who were very close in their performance, looks like more than last year. It means that to arrive at the front you have to work very well during the weekend and arrive strong on Sunday.\u201d he said during the press conference. Marc Marquez (Repsol Honda Team) heads into 2016 looking to continue improving after taking major steps forward in the Qatar Test, he\u00a0remains aware that Qatar may not be representative of the riders\u2019 true level. The 2015 season was Andrea Iannone\u2019s (Ducati Team) first MotoGP podium, the Italian building on the great result throughout the year to challenge for many more podiums. With constant work back in the Ducati factory, there\u2019s little doubt the Italian will again be in mix, especially in Qatar, a track that has classically suited Ducati. Much like Pedrosa, Iannone suffered from a lingering issue throughout the 2015 season. He was expected to undergo surgery on his shoulder during the off-season, but he opted to focus on physiotherapy. The most impressive rider during the test was Maverick Vi\u00f1ales (Team Suzuki Ecstar), the Suzuki rider topping the Phillip Island Test and ending third at the Qatar Test. All eyes are on Vi\u00f1ales as many are expecting big things from him this season.\u00a0 Free Practice 1 begins at 19:55 Local Time on Thursday the 17th\u00a0of March after the traditional \u2018school photo\u2019 at 14:45 Local Time. \u00a0"}

{"subject": "Line Up of Red Bull Racers at MotoGP Qatar 2016", "username": "Qatar Living", "topic": "welcome-qatar", "question": "The premier motorcycle racing World Championship unleashes its engines at Losail International Circuit in Qatar tonight \u2013 20th March, 2016, where all racers will be put to the ultimate test of motorcycling racing to determine the 1st champion of the MotoGP 2016 Championship. Here's a glimpse of the 5 Red Bull speed maniacs competing to clinch the first race title tonight: How old was Marquez when he climbed onto a bike? He was only 4 years old! Born with a natural motorcycling talent & with his passion for motorcycle racing, he did a successful debut season in the world well-known CEV Championship in 2006, and joined Team Repson KTM in 2008 as he participated in the World Championship. At the British Grand Prix, he became the youngest ever Spaniard (15 years and 127 days) to secure a podium finish! Fast forward to 2013, Marc wrote history by becoming the world's youngest ever MotoGP champion! This year, he aims to reclaim the MotoGP title he missed in 2015 with his Repsol Honda team. Will he make it? He was just four when he got his first 50cc motorbike, which came complete with stabilizers. After successfully earning his place in MotoGP class in 2006, he finished in second place in his first race ever with Repsol Honda! 2012 was Dani's best season to date \u2013 as he won 7 races, which is most of any rider including the ultimate World Champion Jorge Lorenzo! In 2013, Dani put on an exceptional performance and won 3 races and podium 13 times! In 2015, he finished in 4th place overall. What has he got up his sleeves this year? We're yet to find out... The first time he rode a motorbike, his father had to hold on to him! Racing runs in his bloodline, considering that he is the son of Grand Prix motorcycle road racer Helmut Bradl! Stefan's racing career began in the World Championship in 2005. Sustaining a few ups and downs during the course of 5 years, he moved to the Moto2 class in 2010, winning the Portuguese GP and placing ninth overall. Moving up the ladder to MotoGP in 2012, Bradl handled the 1000cc machinery with perfection, with the LCR Honda team. 2015 witnessed his change in machinery to Aprilia. It looks like 2016 will be a strong year with his new team. After becoming a national champion in dirt bikes racing, Miller switched to road racing, when he clinched a 125cc national title before turning his attentions towards Europe. After his first full season in 2012, it was 2013 where Miller really broke through with his performance. In 2014, Miller joined Red Bull KTM Ajo team and surprised everyone with his exceptional skills in Moto3, earning a total of six wins, 10 podiums and second overall in Moto3. He was so good that LCR Honda Team snatched him from Moto3 right away up to MotoGP class, skipping Moto2! This year, with the switch of teams to link up with Marc VDS crew, Miller is definitely considered a threat to his competition, and a fun fellow to support! For Maverick, it began when he was 3 years old, when he jumped onto two wheels. At the age of 12, he became Catalan champion in road racing discipline. In 2009, he finished second overall in the Spanish 125cc series, and won it the year after. From 2011 onwards, Maverick's success extended beyond Barcelona, as he raced in Moto3 till end of 2013, earning titles and finishing in podiums. 2014 saw his move to Moto2, where he landed three victories throughout the season and earning 'Rookie Of The Year' award. It was only ideal from Suzuki to snatch him for MotoGP in 2015, where he finished the season in 11th place in the World Championship rankings, and secured best results of 6th place in Catalonia and Australia. All eyes are on the Spanish rider for 2016 MotoGP Championship..."}

The pair took to the pitch together, Rossi supported by the likes of Nicolo Bulega, Niccolo Antonelli, Lorenzo Baldassarri, Franco Morbidelli, Luca Marini, Romano Fenati, Andrea Migno and Francesco Bagnaia while Hernandez was joined by the Aspire Academy team and former Espanyol player Sergio Garcia. A seven-aside format was played with two 10-minute halves.  Kick off was followed by a goal for the Aspire Academy squad, the team backing it up with another point soon after. The Aspire Academy team took a clear lead as a shot from the half way line made it three to nothing just ahead of half time. During the second half the VR46 squads stepped up their defence and with the help of Xavi joining their side, were able to close the score to 3-2 as full time approached. The final whistle blew with the Aspire Academy taking victory 3-2. \"As a football lover, getting the opportunity to play against a great player as Xavi Hernandez is something very special. I told my team to do their best and really go for it, but there was little we could do against such a line-up!\" said Valentino Rossi after the match. Xavi Hernandez stated that \"Sharing an experience like this with a motorcycling legend like Valentino Rossi is unique. I\u2019m proud to take part in a game like this against him and his team and I have to admit they were really into it and playing for the win, not just training!\" MotoGP World Championship begins the 2016 season under the Qatar floodlights. Free Practice begun at 18:00 Local Time on today at the Losail International Circuit."}

He will start on the front of the grid, after securing his fourth Qatar Grand Prix pole position. Lorenzo came in first position with a time record of 1m54.543s, 0.091s ahead of Marc Marques; the Spaniard set a 1\u201954.634s to line up second on the grid. Marverick Vinales secured a place on the front row when he came in third with a record time of 1\u201954.693 on his final lap of the session. This is his second front row start in the premier class Andrea Iannone came in fourth ahead of Valentino Rossi with a 1m54.693s. With a top speed of 349.7km/h, Andrea proved that the Ducati is still a force to be reckoned with on the straights. Fresh off announcing a new two-year contract with Yamaha, Valentino Rossi completed the top five, losing out in the final sector. Cal Crutchlow, Bradley Smith and Scott Redding completed the top 12, and formed an entirely British fourth row. All of the top 12 were within 0.965s. There was an unfortunate fall during Q1 for Aleix Espargaro as he slid off at Turn 1, sprinting back to the pits on his second bike. He was able to head back out with four minutes of Q1 remaining.Alvaro Bautista suffered a late fall during the session at Turn 14, both riders were unhurt. Danilo Petrucci will not be racing on Sunday following complications with his right hand injury. Sunday the 20th of March will see the first race of the year, starting at 21:00 Local Time at the Losail International Circuit. \u00a0"}

A late decision saw Jorge Lorenzo switch to the softer rear Michelin tyre just half an hour before the start of the first race of 2016. With each circulation Lorenzo improved in speed, setting the fastest race lap record of 1\u201954.927s on the 20th lap. He finished the race 2.019s ahead of Dovizioso, who came in second. Lorenzo produced one of the best races of his career after a number of new technical rules presented a world of unknowns for the MotoGP World Championship on race day. He has started his title defense in a faultless way; pole position, a race win and the fastest lap of the race. Niccolo Antonelli claimed the first win of the year after beating Brad Binder in the Moto3 race, who came in second with a slight difference of 0.007s. This is Antonelli\u2019s third career victory and his best ever start to a season. The Italian rider, who caused further damage to his collar bone injury during practice, rode through the pain to claim the title. This will be Brad Binder\u2019s seven career podium and the best opening round he has ever had.\u00a0 The South African took the lead for the most of the race but unfortunately missed out on the first race win. Thomas Luthi takes the win in the Moto2 race with a record time of 40\u201914.293s, 9.910s ahead of Luis Salom who finished second with a 40\u201923.903s. As Luthi took the lead, Nakagami and Robin Mulhauser were also handed ride through penalties for jumping the race start. Luis Salom and Simone Corsi finished the race in first and second respectively, earning themselves a place on the podium. Lorenzo, Niccolo and Luthi leave the opening race leading the championship with 25 points. \u00a0"}

Isn\u2019t it strange that you always discover a lot more when you travel to a new place, as opposed to if you were living in the same place? We get so caught up in our routine lives that exploring our city takes a backseat. \u2018Who has time for that?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s all the same anyway\u2019, are common grievances. Well, that is just an illusion our humdrum routines have deluded us into! You all deserve a refreshing break. How about starting with a shift in perspective? My perspective shift happened when my friends were visiting Qatar for the first time last year. While shopping with them, my friend remarked, \"How do you stand all this! Beautiful landscapes and the perfect shopping haven! I would never get bored in Qatar!\" She has been on several shopping sprees in Dubai before. But Qatar just won her heart. I realized the poignancy of her remark and gratitude was rekindled in my heart. It\u2019s time to explore Qatar again with fresh eyes. What better way to see Qatar with fresh eyes than that of tourists and visitors? TripAdvisor is the best traveling website online. Going through the comments of visitors in Qatar was uplifting. Among important landmarks in Doha, Souq Waqif, Katara, Museum of Islamic Art, Corniche were hands down the favorites among them. Well here is a scoop of what fellow dwellers and tourists of this wonderland have to say about Qatar. A Souq Waqif enthusiast   shared her experience in May 2016: Remember \u2018The Arabian Nights\u2019? The childhood fascination with flying carpets and running carefree in the streets of Agrabah. Interestingly, one visitor\u2019s imagination was triggered by the same memory upon visiting Souq Waqif.\u00a0 TripAdvisor user   commented on March 2016 about Souq Waqif: Another insightful perspective is shared by   who visited Souq in November 2015: Photo credit:  The same person,   remarks about what was fascinating about the most popular museum in Doha, Museum of Islamic Art: Photo credit:  Qatar\u2019s landscape resplendent with awe-inspiring architecture and well-manicured parks and lawns is just one aspect to its charm. Here is a testimonial that well sums up what Qatar offers. A user on the site,  , reports after visiting the Pearl, Qatar: Photo credit:  Katara is a cultural hotspot and a hub of creative and artistic activities.   from UK visited Katara in September 2015 and sums up the experience beautifully: \u00a0 Photo credit:  People love hopping over to the Corniche, be it for a jog, a stroll along the water, a picnic with family, or to just lie down in the grass and snooze away. A lovely comment was given by   about Corniche: Photo credit:  , an avid Corniche goer and knows his way around dhow tours, has this advice to offer: \u00a0 Photo credit:  The charm of the Middle East is well captured in these accounts. Intrigued visitors plan their trip with a vague image in mind from previous accounts and research online. But until one is physically in a place, its charisma and ambience cannot be understood. Visitors find the steady pace of Qatar soothing. It is not harried, and it offers everything gently at the convenience of the traveler/resident. This is why visitors leave Qatar happy, with a longing in their hearts to return soon. \u00a0 Comments of visitors from  Cover photo credit: "}

He practices things which have never been practiced by the companions of prophets or currently practiced by the acknowledged Muslim scholars of today. 2) In a well known Hadith Prophet Muhammad has prohibited his companion Umar (R) not to handle other people's scriptures. Even though Prophet Muhammad claimed that he was foretold in previous scriptures he never tried to prove it by examining other people's scriptures or encouraged others to do so even when he had a chance. Now this is during the period when the previous scriptures were relatively pure. Now what Zakir Naik is going to prove with today's Books which he himself claims to be full of fabrications? 3) If Zakir Naik methods are so great why it is not promoted or practiced by the Arab Islamic learning centers? 4) If Zakir Naik is such a brilliant person why he doesnt do something great in the field he studied (medicine) -for example find medicine for Aids or Zika virus - and not where he is qualified to do? 5) Freedom of faith is not a one way road. Will Muslim countries allow proponents of other faiths to do to Islam what Zakir Naik does to them? I believe they should not. Nor should they allow Zakir to do it! 6) Zakir methods will breed only resentment in other religious followers and a false sense of superiority in members of Muslim community, thus affecting inter-religious harmony. For example as an Indian Muslim I consider Zakir Naik to be a great nuisance to Indian Muslims, creating religious discord and worsening Muslim's situation there, all for nothing. If he had done something to better the position of Indian Muslims it would have been welcome, which of course is not his cup of tea. 7) Question to promotors of Zakir Naik videos in Qatar.

The 2012 Chevy Sonic isn't the smallest car in the category, but it's not as accommodating or flexible as the 2012 Honda Fit. Nor is the interior as polished as the 2012 Hyundai Accent's. And while it proves impressively athletic when pushed, it doesn't encourage that sort of behavior as much as the 2012 Ford Fiesta. Lancer 2010 You'll Like This Car If... The 2010 Mitsubishi Lancer will prove most appealing to those who appreciate both its sporty demeanor and the combination of in-cabin technology features rarely offered in this category. You May Not Like This Car If...

It looks to be a promising and exciting year for the duo, as they traded last year\u2019s MINI for a Toyota Hilux for the six day race in the United Arab Emirates. \u00a0 Toyota have been quite successful during the past \u00a0 \u00a0with cars on the podium at four of the last five editions of the off-road marathon.. With double championship points up for grabs in Abu Dhabi, it\u2019s important for Nasser to kick off the new season off to a flying start given the packed schedule he has on his hands for the year ahead. It\u2019s quite possible that Nasser will miss out in two 2016 World Cup races due to taking part in the men\u2019s skeet shooting event at this year\u2019s Olympic Games in Rio. \u00a0 Nasser and co-driver Mathieu Baumel were in imperious form last season as they collected five races wins en route to securing a memorable overall triumph. \u00a0A runners-up result in the Dakar at the beginning of the year was the most recent example of Nasser\u2019s expert off road driving abilities and Mathieu\u2019s eagle eyed navigational skills. Both men will once again need to be on the top of their game if they are to make it a repeat of Nasser\u2019s win at this event in 2008. The action gets underway on Saturday, 2nd April with a prologue stage on the tarmac of the Yas Marina Circuit before nearly 1,500km of dune crossings in the Liwa Desert spread over five days.\u00a0 \u00a0"}

When i took it to a dent fixing place a month later in Industrial area , he polished it for free for me :-)", "commentId": "comment-7186171"}, {"username": "fgnhgn", "comment": "Try wellebe car services in st 17 near to kassarat st..

Without a vehicle, getting from point A to B can be an excruciating affair. While buying a car is easy, maintaining it is the tougher part. But if you are a little careful, you can protect your car from long-term damage to its parts. It will in turn reduce maintenance charges. Here are a few tips that may help you protect your car\u2019s moving parts. \u00a0 The starter motor takes a lot of energy from the battery to start the car. Keeping the AC/stereo on while starting will only add to the battery\u2019s load. This will cause the battery to die faster than it should in the long run. \u00a0 Starting to push your car to high speeds soon after starting the engine, especially during winters, is a big no-no. Ideally you should start your car and put it in idle for up to a minute before moving. This is because when the car has been parked for a while, all oils (engine/transmission/brake) are cold. It takes time for the oil to circulate and come up to temperature. Accelerating hard immediately means the engine works extra, with minimum lubrication, which can only mean excessive wear & tear. \u00a0 Car manufacturers have a reason for having service schedules. When a car is designed, lots of research goes into the life of parts being used. And a service schedule is drawn up. Hence, delay in servicing could lead to excessive wear and tear. It is always advisable to change engine oil and filters at regular intervals. \u00a0 When you\u2019re driving, an error lamp on the dashboard goes on. What should you do? Our advice is to immediately pull up, get the owner\u2019s manual and check what it means. It could be as simple as a faulty bulb or as serious as no oil in the engine. Do not ignore the warning lamps. They are there for a reason. \u00a0 It\u2019s a common fad to accelerate as soon as the lights turns green and wait for the last possible moment to brake in order to maximize speed quotient and thrill. Be warned, this is going to kill your car\u2019s engine, transmission and other components in the long run. \u00a0 I have been guilty of doing this. It may seem like a good idea to pressure wash your engine to keep it spic and span, but there are a lot of sensitive components in the engine that can get exposed and damaged. It is highly unadvisable. \u00a0 Most people ignore the car\u2019s tyres for long periods of time. While many don\u2019t bother to check tyres regularly, others are happy to drive on as long as the car\u2019s moving. Remember, it could prove deadly. Bald tyres generate more friction and hence heat. It could lead to blown tyres over longer distances. It can also cause your car to skid if there is water on the road. \u00a0 This advice is especially important, as a majority of cars in Qatar are automatics. Engaging reverse gear while your car is still moving forward will put a lot of stress on your transmission and accelerate wear and tear on it. Each transmission has gears inside it. When you shift from reverse to drive, the direction of rotation of gears is reversed. When you do it with the car in motion, it\u2019ll make the gears act as a brake. It\u2019s going to cause massive damage to the drive shaft. \u00a0 If your car is making funny noises, it\u2019s better to listen to your car. While it may not be a life threatening issue, it could have the potential to build up to be one. Get it checked."}

People come to Qatar with an idea of what it\u2019s going to be like. The real discovery begins after they\u2019ve settled in. Qatar has a plethora of hidden gems ranging from all sorts of activities and events embedded in its culture. Here are some things you can enjoy in Qatar while learning about its culture as well. You will get the real essence of Qatar through these traditions and sports. Don\u2019t miss out on wonderful experiences! Gold is always in style in Qatar. With a market of steady customers, the gold buying trend is rampant in this Arabian land. Many shops and souqs are dedicated to this market. In fact there is a whole marketplace called the Gold Souq where gold jewelry and commodities are sold. The most frequent buyers are Asians and the designs can range from Arabic, Indian, Pakistani, and western cuts to Persian and Turkish jewelry. Gold brings us to a very interesting phenomenon that happens daily and is associated with jewelry. A man sings, weaves patterns and colors into bangles at Souq waqif daily. Mohammed Aslam Maniyar sits from 6pm to 1am daily outside the Royal Tandoor restaurant and casts resin, glitter and copper over hot coals and molds them into bangles, to the awe and delight of spectators. Next time you visit Souq Waqif, make sure you experience the live entertainment from this talented man, and have some bangles created for yourself or your friends. \u00a0 If you are a guy, are Qatari, or have Qatari friends, chilling in majlis is the experience you must go for at least once. Majlis is an integral part of the Qatari life. The word is derived from \u2018ajlis\u2019, which means \u2018to\u00a0 sit\u2019, and that\u2019s what it implies in this context too. The historical significance of majlis was to gather people together and share common concerns, pray and pursue knowledge. Nowadays you can gather with friends and just relax at the majlis, with a number of games at hand. The hospitable environment usually has arrangements for Arabic coffee and you can order any kind of food you want. Living in the desert, and not eaten a camel yet? I know it sounds a tad bit radical if you\u2019ve never thought of it before, but do give it a try. Camel meat was a staple food for travelers and across the region and they brought it with dates to make a good trade. Camel meat dishes are delicacies in the Arabic culture and are easily available at supermarkets. Treat your taste buds to a camel steak next time you plan a dinner at an Arabic restaurant. Qatar follows specific cultural attire which is crisp and elegant. Men wear the thobe, which is a long shirt that is immaculate and neat. They wear \u2018Gutra\u2019 on their heads which is a red and white or red and black checkered cloth tied in place with a twice looped coild called Iqab. \u00a0Women dress modestly with a Shayla covering their hair, and an Abaya over clothes, which is like a full cloak. Try the traditional dress if it\u2019s offered somewhere, along with the photography session. If you fancy the look and want to wear it sometimes, go for it and get the full attire for yourself. Originally used to track and hunt down birds of prey with a falcon, falconry has gained more of a sporting fame in the current days. Souq Waqif falconry trains falcons and you can buy them from there. Be a part of a falconry expedition to get a hands-on feel of raw hunting out in the desert. Just bear in mind that it\u2019s no easy sport and you need fortitude and consistency to train and get attuned to the falcons in hunting. The whole experience is bound to be full of adventure! Dama is the Arabic form of chess. Qatari fishermen used to play it on a piece of cloth as a means of entertainment after grueling hours of work. Now the game is played on boards. Head over to Souq Waqif\u2019s Majlis Al Dama for Arabic coffee (qehwa), and Dama tournaments. Learn the game and test your opponent over a friendly battle of wits. Another adventure out in the desert synonymous to Qatar is the dune bashing/buggy riding. Be a part of the desert safari and see for yourself what rugged wonders the Qatar terrain holds. Couple the pleasure with a memorable BBQ on the beach after a few well spent hours of adrenaline rush riding on the dunes. Horse riding is exciting, but camel racing is unique to this part of the world. At Al Shahaniya Camel Racetrack, you can witness this fast and furious race of sturdy camels on tournament days. The sport is charming for visitors of all ages; children will be especially thrilled by it. You can\u2019t go wrong with this one. Shopping malls in Qatar are a constant pull and you end up buying more than you anticipated when you set out on the mission. Get a taste of the traditional market by shopping in a souq. Souq Waqif offers an exotic experience of shopping with its wide variety of goods. Clothes, perfumes, jewelry, pet market, scarves all sit pretty inside the souq corridors, waiting for your appraising eyes. Be ready to haggle a bit with the shopkeepers; you will master the art of shopping once you get to bargain the right price for items."}

The new four-seater marks a major evolution of the sporting Grand Tourer concept by integrating rear-wheel steering with four-wheel drive for the first time. The GTC4Lusso's name references illustrious predecessors, such as the 330 GTC or its 2+2 sister model, the 330 GT and the 250 GT Berlinetta Lusso, which represented a sublime combination of elegance and high performance. The number 4 alludes to the car's four comfortable seats. Powered by a 12-cylinder engine, the GTC4Lusso punches out a massive 690 cv at a 8,000 rpm and peak torque of 697 Nm at 5,750 rpm, with 80% available at just 1,750 rpm. The GTC4Lusso delivers an astonishing top speed of 335 km/h and sprints from 0 to 100 km in 3.4 seconds. Both its 13.5:1 compression ratio and its 2.6 kg/cv weight-to-power-ratio set new records for the category. \"The GTC4Lusso brings unprecedented versatility to Ferrari driving, enabling our customers to discover a whole new dimension of Ferrari. The strikingly sporty coupe promises to satisfy customers with a thirst for speed and power, without compromising on in-car comfort, sporty elegance and impeccable detailing. Ferrari Qatar is always committed to deliver beyond our customer's expectations and offer them the pleasure of driving a Ferrari anywhere, anytime,\" said Charly Dagher, General Manager Ferrari Qatar at Alfardan Sports Motors. Penned by Ferrari Design, the GTC4Lusso is a further refinement of the shooting brake coup\u00e9 that comes with an extremely streamlined, tapered shape giving it an almost fastback-like silhouette. Its sporty soul is underscored by the forms and styling of the rear where the curve of the roof has been lowered whilst retaining enough volume to guarantee exceptional space and comfort for all four occupants, as well as an ample luggage compartment. The supercar coupe's interior exudes a flawless air of sporty luxury thanks to the carefully executed detailing. Its Dual Cockpit architecture is another first, designed to enhance the shared driving experience for both driver and passenger. The GTC4Lusso also debuts the new Infotainment platform featuring a 10.25\" HD screen with capacitive touch technology. The new steering wheel is more compact thanks to a smaller air bag and the integrated controls are more ergonomic than ever, making for an even sportier driving experience.

The teachers at an elementary school in Sarat Ubaida in the southwestern part of Saudi Arabia said that the principal did not consult with them or with the local education district before deciding to install the cameras. They argued that the cameras were a breach of their privacy and damaged their status in front of their students, and called for their immediate removal. However, the principal turned down the request and insisted on keeping the cameras, prompting the teachers to formally address the authorities to step into the issue and revoke the \u201carbitrary measure that disrupted the educational and learning processes,\u201d Saudi news site Sabq reported on Tuesday. Most social media users sided with the principal, calling for spreading the concept of cameras inside classrooms to other schools. \u201cWe should have surveillance cameras in all schools and only teachers who have something to hide refuse cameras,\u201d Munattaf, a user, posted. \u201cTeachers cannot talk about privacy when they are referring to classrooms since they are public. If they privacy, they should stay home and enjoy it. At the same time, cameras can be used by teachers themselves in case there is an issue with rowdy students or physical assault on them by aggressive students.\u201d Al Dossary said that she welcomed the presence of cameras in classrooms as the best motivator for teachers to excel in their work and for students to behave normally."}

But they wanted Yahoo to look for a set of characters. That could mean a phrase in an email or an attachment. The agency also said it was unable to determine what data the company had handed over, and if the intelligence officials had approached other email providers besides Yahoo. According to two former employees, Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's decision to obey the directive angered some senior executives and led to the June 2015 departure of Chief Information Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now holds the top security job at Facebook. US phone and Internet companies are known to have handed over bulk customer data to intelligence agencies.

Upon speaking to the designers, who flew to Doha from Italy for the opening, one could see the passion, enthusiasm, and dedication they carried towards their creations.

He took great pride that the high calibre quality of the furniture within the store was all Italian made and designed. Spazio Interni actually offers authentic Murano glass chandeliers and decor, which are imported directly from Europe to customers in Qatar. Below is the fabulous piece playfully titled \u201cdolphins\u201d. \u00a0 Spazio Interni was the brainchild of Qatari entrepreneur, Mansour Abdul Latif Al Mahmoud.

It\u2019s a euphemistic way of saying kids below 12 years of age aren\u2019t welcome in certain parts of the plane, which usually includes seats in the front and over the wings with extra leg room. The controversial idea is popular with frequent flyers \u2014 and anyone who has been locked in a cabin beside a screaming infant or naughty youngster \u2014 but it\u2019s sparked ire among families. \u201cThe policy is discriminatory,\u201d a disgruntled customer told the Hindustan Times. According to Jeff Edwards of Flyer Talk, the idea of adult-only cabins seemed ready to take the industry by storm, but it caused a logistic nightmare for airlines faced with policing seats in cases of delay, cancellation and changed bookings. He described the idea as \u201cmore of a passing fad than a revolution in air travel\u201d. It\u2019s no secret most people hate travelling next to children. In a study commissioned by British booking company LateDeals.co.uk in 2014, almost 70 per cent of respondents said they\u2019d like to see child-free areas on planes. About a quarter said kid-free zones should be compulsory on long-haul flights, and nearly a third said quiet rows were necessary to ensure stress-free travels for non-parenting passengers. Thirty-five per cent said they\u2019d pay more to travel on an entirely child-free flight. \u201cHow would people feel if an airline touted special sections excluding people for similarly arbitrary reasons?\u201d parent Matt Villano wrote for Parenting.com in 2012. \u201cI can almost envision the day JetBlue reserves four rows for people with less than two per cent body-fat ... suck it up! We family travelers have every right to fly with our kids, and we\u2019ll be damned if we let [you] take that away from us.\u201d Budget airlines charge for all optional extras, including exit row seats, baggage and meals. Maybe more carriers will start rolling out other types of quiet zones."}

We support this", "commentId": "comment-7407656"}], "question": "DOHA: The Ministry of Economy and Commerce has asked all business entities to use Arabic as the main language in invoices, service lists, product labels and warnings about health risks of any product. Hotels, shopping malls, car showrooms, maintenance centres and other stores have also been asked to assign at least one Arabic-speaking employee at their reception desks, if they require that service. An Arabic speaker is required to process consumer complaints and inquiries and provide after-sales services at customer service centres in malls and call centres, according to a circular (No. 5) issued by the Ministry. All business entities have been given time until March 31 to complete the Arabisation of bills, lists of services, product labels and customer/call centre services. The ministry said yesterday that it has launched the initiative \u201cafter noticing an increase in the use of foreign languages when providing information on products and services, issuing invoices and providing customers support.\u201d This has led to a lack of transparency and difficulty in accessing information on various goods and services provided to the customers, it added. The move comes in line with the law No (8) of 2008 on consumer protection. Article (7), (8) and (11) of the law compel suppliers to use Arabic when labelling and packaging products, issuing invoices to consumers and providing description of goods and their prices and properties, with the possibility of offering them in another language . For services such as beauty salons, hotels, maintenance centres, travel and tourism agencies, the providers are obliged to assign at least one Arabic-speaking employee at reception desks and use Arabic language when providing service information on labels and advertisements, with the possibility of offering such information in a second language. They must assign at least one Arabic-speaking employee to explain properties of their service to customers. They must also use Arabic language when giving service information to the customers, including its advantages, disadvantages and price, with the possibility of using an additional language. They must issue invoices in Arabic to document transactions or agreements with consumers regarding products or services and use Arabic language in guarantee statements, with the possibility of using an additional language. They must hire an Arabic speaker to process consumer complaints and inquiries and provide after-sales services. The above requirements also apply to suppliers and providers of products such as cars, electronics, clothes, toys and consumer goods. Additionally, they must use Arabic language (with the possibility of using another language) when displaying data pertaining to the use and installation of products or statements concerning the need to hire technicians in case the products is made of several parts, said the ministry. The Ministry has called on all traders, service providers and owners of major outlets that don\u2019t offer statements and invoices in Arabic to comply with the circular and to Arabise data, billing and other services provided to consumers. The ministry said that after the given deadline, it will conduct inspection campaigns to ensure the businesses comply with the instructions and necessary legal action will be taken in case of violations. http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/11/10/2016/Arabic-must-in-invoices-and-purchase-bills"}

Almost every area in Doha is dotted with litters and more litters and as difficult as it might be, we must do our bit to take care of them. You don't have to love cats, all you need is a little humanity to make a huge difference.  - Cats feel thirsty too. And they barely have access to any water. Buy a few small plastic or aluminium bowls to keep in your car, especially if you drive. Every time you see strays, pour some water and leave it for them to drink. They might run away initially, but once you leave the spot, they will come back and drink it up.  - Cat food is quite inexpensive and a bag or box of it will cost you an average of merely 15 - 20 QR. Keep a bag of cat food in your car to feed cats whenever you get a chance. Again, they might get scared and run away but leave some for them anyway.  - As tempting as it might be to buy exotic breeds and even regular ones, save your money and give a forever home to a cat who has been abandoned or just a stray. There are several rescue centers from where you can adopt cats.  - This might not be an easy task, but will make a great difference to the growing cat population in Qatar. Don't worry about how much it might cost you because the government vet center on Airport Road does it for free.  - There are many volunteer organizations and rescue centers who are in dire need of volunteers. Spending one day of your week to help at these centers will make a huge difference. It is also a chance to play with and care for cats, especially if you can't have one of your own.  - If volunteering itself is too much for you, remember that these centers have high running costs and are constantly in need of funds. Every penny you donate will come in handy for them. If you don't want to donate cash, there's lots of other things you can do like participate in their sales, or raise funds for these organizations in any way you can. These are not at all difficult to do and require minimum efforts. Always remember that having a pet is a commitment, and one mustn't do it if he/she is ultimately going to abandon it."}

Beaches in Qatar are great for getaways, especially now that the weather is getting better. We decided to list five beaches in Qatar (with map links) that we think you should visit. We intentionally left out Mesaeed Sealine beach and Al Wakra family beach due to the massive crowds both venues attract, making it uncomfortable for most people. Historically the location of a desert camp for the country\u2019s scouting movement; this beach is now a common weekend getaway for campers. There is a beach resort as well as a popular sandy beach to the north. You may not need a 4x4 SUV for this one, which makes it all the more convenient for many. Khor Al Udaid is split between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and has a shore in both countries. It's popular for the inland sea, located south of Qatar. Four-wheel-drive vehicles are necessary and only experienced drivers should attempt the journey. Local tour operators also organise day trips and overnight camps to the area. You definitely need a 4x4 SUV for this, and we recommend that you go there in multiple groups. If you know the terrain quite well, then nothing is stopping you from going alone. If you were prepared for a long 4x4 GPS drive to a beach, this is the place. Surrounded by stunning limestone formations, crystal clear but salty water and perfectly clean beaches. In the \"winter\" months there are a few more people around, but the area is so vast that number of people won't be a problem. Absolutely no facilities. Get everything you need. Also known as 42km beach or the French beach \u2013 Maroona is a small beach 80km north of Doha. It\u2019s a good place to enjoy the water but the sand is too fine and not quite suitable for pitching tents. This beach affords an unusual sight of eroded hills meeting the water\u2019s edge. The area has a fine sandy bay with coves that make good picnic spots.\u00a0Also, look out for the beautiful and picturesque eroded hills in unusual formations. They make for great photographs during sunset."}

Qatar is known for its rich culture, yet it embraces people from all over the world. Qatar is enriched with a heritage that it holds close to its heart, yet has a contemporary vision of a progressive and enlightened nation. The following are just a few of my favorite things in Qatar: One of the best things about Qatar is the hospitality of its people. From the moment you enter Qatar till the time you leave (if you ever do), you will be inundated with the generosity and warmth of its people. From the greeting with the warmest of handshakes and kissing on the cheeks to the serving of the traditional Arabic coffee with dates, from the friendly embraces to the sharing of their traditional food-all are symbolic of the Qatari tradition of hospitality. Known as one of the world's most secure and safest of countries, Qatar is loved by nationals and expats alike. Qatar is also one of the most stable countries, especially in the Gulf region, in terms of political and religious environment. Residents can move around freely all over the country without having to worry about their belongings or their wellbeing. There are isolated cases of theft, but those are few and far between. In general, life is enjoyable because the crime rate is so low. Qatar is a metropolitan country made up of Qataris and expats from all over the globe. There are a large number of local and expat clubs along with events and activities that bring the different communities closer together. People are friendly; they are ever-ready to welcome new arrivals and do whatever they can to make them comfortable. Since people come from all walks of life, you are bound to find someone who shares your culture and tastes, or you can mingle with the different nationalities and learn about their cultures. Healthcare in Qatar is another thing to be proud of. Qualified and experienced doctors, state-of-the-art medical equipment, the latest facilities, make up Qatar's healthcare system in both the private and government sectors. Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar's public healthcare provider, boasts of a vast network of clinics and hospitals catering to every medical need possible. This service is free for Qataris and available at a subsidized rate for all expats. A health card is needed which can be obtained for Qar.100 and used at any public health service. In addition, there are the numerous pay-as-you-go or insurance covered private hospitals and clinics. Health insurance is not provided by the government. It is. However, it is compulsory for companies to provide insurance to its employees and their families. Made up of independent public schools provided government funding and providing free education to Qataris and eligible residents, private international schools with different curricula (International Baccalaureate, British, American, Indian, Pakistani, European, etc.) along with local and recognized foreign universities, the standards for education are high in Qatar. No matter where you are from, there is a school that will cater to your needs providing your children quality education and knowledge that will help them in the future."}
{"subject": "QL Special: 11 souvenirs you can take home from Qatar", "username": "shereendsouzaqsg", "topic": "welcome-qatar", "question": "The best souvenirs are often useful or beautiful. It should mean something to yourself or the person you're giving it to. To help you in your hunt for useful or meaningful souvenirs, we have created a list of things that we think are the real best things to bring home from Qatar.  \u2013 Technically, these are not exclusive to Qatar and you can find them in pretty much all Gulf countries, but the Arab man and woman salt and pepper shakers are too cute to not pick up one. They cost roughly QR 10, and are great for your dining table.  \u2013 Although you will get them for far cheaper in places like Turkey, these lamps are really pretty and add a really unique touch of colour and ethnicity to your personal space. They are quite expensive though, depending on where you buy from them. But they are definitely something to own.  \u2013 Dallah is a traditional Arabic coffee pot used to serve Qahwa, and comes with matching cups as well. This can serve as a great decorative piece, if you don't actually want to use it, and even adds a nice touch of Arabian elements to your modern setting. You can find them pretty much everywhere in Souq Waqif.  \u2013 You can get this done at Souq Waqif. Have your name carved out in a pendant in Arabic either in silver, or in gold.  \u2013 Even if you do not burn incense, these are great souvenirs to keep in your home, or even gift someone. The traditional markets usually have a great variety of these in different shapes and forms. You have to purchase the incense separately  \u2013 Yes this is a real thing. You can find camel milk chocolates from Al Nassma Chocolate, which is available in Qatar, although it is a Dubai based brand. Available at Gourmet House in West Bay.  \u2013 Although there is nothing Arabic about the pashmina shawls in Souq Waqif, they do have beautiful patterns and colors and the best part of this souvenir is the price. You can bargain for as low as QR 15. And get the most beautiful scarf ever!  \u2013 Again, nothing Arabic about this, but for some reason, shisha is strongly tied to local culture and nothing screams Middle East like a shisha set for a souvenir. While you can get really miniature ones if you want it just for decoration, you might as well purchase slightly bigger one, and use them!  \u2013 Don't buy just dates, indulge in the fantastic variety of dates that you can find here right from pistachio and nut filled dates to chocolate covered dates, all of the highest quality. These actually make great presents for your friends and family.  \u2013 You can find the purest honey here \u2013 Sidr Honey \u2013 and this is definitely something to take back home. Sidr honey is popular and in demand because of its exquisite taste, its health benefits as a natural medicine, and several other reasons. Sidr honey is more premium and luxurious.  \u2013 These are the regular souvenirs one picks up from any country they usually visit. A shot glass from Qatar might be quite ironic but hey, plus points for being creative! You can find all of these in Souq Waqif."}
{"subject": "QTA celebrate season finale with Qatar Living and other partners", "username": "Qatar Living", "topic": "welcome-qatar", "question": "Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA) held an appreciation event to recognise the partners who contributed to an eventful 2016 summer season in Qatar. Both Eid Celebrations and the Qatar Summer Festival, which are three of the country's most anticipated nation-wide events, were held in succession between July and September. These tourism festivals serve to energise the retail and hospitality sectors in a typically off-peak period. To acknowledge their efforts and support, QTA hosted representatives of government ministries and agencies, sponsors, media, participants and volunteers in a recognition ceremony at the St. Regis Hotel in Doha today. The Qatar Living team was also in attendance for the closing ceremony. Qatar Living was the official community partner for both QSF2016 and Eid Celebrations. \"As Qatar's largest online social portal, we're happy that our contributions helped in bringing the community together. We had a lot of fun working with QTA and I am sure the community enjoyed all our activities,\" said Bilal Randeree, Managing Randeree at Qatar Living. Qatar Living successfully orchestrated the Emojoy activation with QTA during Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha festivals in seven different malls including The Pearl Qatar. \"We're always thinking of innovative ways to keep the community in Qatar engaged, especially during the off-peak summer season. We had hundreds of people talking about the festivals on all QL platforms and participating in our online competitions,\" Randeree added. ( ) Designed to cater to residents and visitors alike, the festivals support a wider strategy to enrich Qatar's annual calendar of events and diversify the year-round tourism offering. Figures show the strategy is beginning to bear fruit; in August alone, the number of visitors that Qatar welcomed was 2% higher than the number received in the same month last year."}

Wakrah is best .. It has beach , restaurants and hospital", "commentId": "comment-7405636"}], "question": "If you are new to Qatar, or are just looking to move houses or apartment, here are a few things to consider.  \u2013 Of course location is the most important factor in your house hunt. Do you want to stay close to work? Do you want to stay in a quiet area? A couple of things to consider in choosing the right location include how far from the city you are willing to go and also the traffic conditions in that area. Sometimes even though you live close to work, you'll end up spending a long time getting in and out of your home due to unpredictable traffic conditions here. There are a few exceptions of course, but the heart of Doha is definitely more crowded, lesser parking spaces and always crowded. Areas like Westbay and the Pearl are a small drive away from the city area, but getting in and out during peak hours is a nightmare.  \u2013 your budget will of course decide on what locality, how big and what kind of apartment or house you need. Average rents in Qatar vary based on what area you want to live in. Doha city rents are lower than areas like the Pearl and Westbay, however they also differ in quality, so choose wisely. You can get a two bedroom apartment for an average of QR 15,000 in The Pearl or West bay or a one bedroom for roughly QR 3,500 in areas like Thumama. Al Wakra has great prices if you are okay with the drive, since it is quite far from the city. Bin Mahmood and Umm Gwailina also have decently priced 2 bedrooms, but these areas are very congested and it will be hard to find parking on the street if your apartment doesn't come with a dedicated parking space.  \u2013 your requirements for types of residences will vary and while an apartment is usually the best option in terms of convenience, expats with families might choose a villa in a compound or even a standalone villa, mostly for how much space will be available for themselves and their kids. Villas might actually work out better in terms of price, considering the amount of space they provide. Beware of partitioned villas, they are illegal.  \u2013 Parking here is a huge problem, especially in the city area due to construction of the metro, road works, etc. Check to ensure that your building comes with a dedicated parking spot, preferably in the basement. Parking your car outside will lead to a really dirty car every morning, because the country can get pretty dusty on most days. Lower priced apartments usually do not have dedicated parking spots. \u00a0\u2013 Interiors and fixtures make a huge difference to your living experience. Depending on the price, the quality of furniture inside your house will vary. A lot of apartments do not even have any natural light entering the house. Also, if you are the kind who is bothered by noise, you might want to check that your new apartment does not have window ACs. Split air conditioning as well as central, are much better, and make almost to no noise. If your flat is fully furnished, check the quality of furniture and also if the building has in house maintenance, because it will be a pain chasing maintenance people every time something breaks or gets damaged.  \u2013 if you are on a budget, finding amenities that come with your accommodation might be impossible. If you are looking for a gym, pool and other such facilities, it might be easier to find these kind of apartments in WestBay or the Pearl. However, there are several good apartments offering good facilities in areas like Al Sadd and Musheireb. Villas within compounds usually mean you have a common clubhouse, shared pool and gym, tennis courts, basketball courts and lots of other facilities."}

And if you are at traffic lights, make your way right to the front if you can, or wait behind large vehicles.

Yes, defensive driving is the need of the hour. I agree with your point of view, acchabaccha. About the people who feel it's beneath their dignity, that sounds immature for anyone who does think that, and I hope it wasn't a personal attack on me :) everyone has reasons and intentions you cannot even fathom, behind their decisions. It's easy to discredit my experiences as mere 'unlucky' ones. But I assure you, after years of patience with taxis, I have finally given up after more unpleasant experiences than pleasant ones recently (I'm talking about regular use). If I am misguided, please point me in the right direction, instead of calling me delusional :P Of course driving is a skill of synchronicity on the road with other drivers. I meant the unruly ones in particular, which are increasing, and certainly pose a road hazard. So let's agree to disagree on this one. Also, how would you see the incidences I mentioned in the case of ladies? I have many lady friends and acquaintances who had similar experiences with rude taxi drivers. I do believe that is a detriment to the taxi industry. If women don't feel safe in public commuting, what's the point? Please mention the companies who have courteous drivers. Manners and kindness are what this world lacks, and it would be a welcome sight to see more of these. I know how taxi drivers are paid, and always tip them. But I don't like sneaky tricks like their asking for more than what shows on the meter, and of course, rude behavior is a pet peeve for me. I did say there are pleasant incidences as well. But if there is potential for improvement, why not work together to achieve it? Instead of just debating about it, let's find solutions. Are you implying that absolutely no changes are required? I am impressed by the traffic rules, but where I see drivers at fault, I shall certainly show my concern. And lastly, everyone saying I should compare it to MY country's traffic scene, I'm all for it. If it brings any solutions to the table, bring it on! All I can say is, I was commenting on the situation in the country where we are all present (I assume most people on this site are in Qatar), as it affects us directly. Anyone wanting to broaden it into a debate with their respective countries, you're welcome. But I don't see the point in it, unless I am commuting on all those roads daily. When I go back to my home country, I will most certainly discuss it daily :)", "commentId": "comment-7308881"}, {"username": "acchabaccha", "comment": "The post is absolutely lopsided. It does not portray the true picture of the taxi service available in Doha. It simply reflects one man's bad experiences in hiring a taxi in this city. Possibly, he might have been a bit unlucky in finding the wrong taxi each time he took one. Things on the ground are not like that. First of all, people driving have their own style and decision-making powers. No two humans are the same. This is just like dealing with another human being. One has to understand the other person. That applies to driving also. As long as there are humans behind the wheel, one has to remain alert while he is driving. It is always possible that you could be making a mistake. How would the other drivers on the road feel or react about you? Secondly, the writer firmly believes that Qatar roads should be absolutely safe, so safe that one could drive blindly and no accidents should take place at all. There is no such place on earth which could be that safe. Accidents take place in other countries also including the one of the writer of this post. Rules and regulations and enforced by governments for the safety of others. However, an accident is the result of human error and as humans we are bound to err. That is the law of nature. Thirdly, there are many taxi drivers on the roads who are both courteous and careful. Try the limousines which are operated by several companies. The drivers of such limousines yearn to earn in a very competitive market. The only tool for attracting passengers is \"courtesy.\" Not only that, if ones makes an agreement on the fare with the driver which most people do before boarding the taxi, there stands no chance of a dispute over the fare. Just to attract passengers and get business, they also charge somewhat lower than the Karwa taxis. Try them out, and your experience with taxis in Doha is bound to change for the better. Lastly, whenever possible, I always find the Karwa bus very convenient. There are no issues with fare, with coming across careless or rude drivers, on finding a parking space, traffic violations etc. It also saves much on your cost and saves traffic congestion. But then, there are many who think it is below their \"dignity\" to travel on a bus and sit beside people who earn a meager QR 2500 or lower.

I haven\u2019t gotten it to this date. Ironical, because as inclined as I was toward driving in Qatar, now I prefer going by taxis or alternate commute here. Can you guess the reason? I bet everyone who drives here knows it. The traffic has worsened and traffic etiquette has declined right before our eyes. Going by some road antics of drivers, it makes me wonder, I could be better than them on the road, but they are exactly what I don\u2019t want to encounter. If being alert is the biggest driving skill, it\u2019s tantamount to being downright stressed just to cope with the unpredictable behavior of incoming traffic. Such unruly drivers are not rampant, but they still come out of nowhere when you least expect it. My alternate means of commuting has been taxis. But by no means has it been a bed of roses. I\u2019ve had good taxi days, and I\u2019ve had terrible taxi days. The worst one was when I booked a taxi to visit a friend, then had to cancel it because my friend\u2019s son got sick and had to be admitted to the hospital. I\u2019d canceled the taxi well in time, ten hours before it was scheduled previously. However, it still showed up. When I explained to the driver on the phone that I don\u2019t need to go, and had canceled it, he became rude and said that was impossible. I thought I\u2019d get some groceries done, since the taxi was there and the driver was not willing to accept that it had been canceled. I went to the nearest grocery store and requested the petulant driver to wait ten minutes while I quickly shopped. He declined and said he had important things to do. I requested again that I won\u2019t be long, and he said he\u2019ll wait, but not more than ten minutes. I took ten minutes in buying the groceries, but the taxi was nowhere to be seen when I was done. I walked back home and phoned the company to complain about the driver\u2019s behavior. I don\u2019t know if complaining is any good, or if the grumpy drivers are checked on their behavior. Then there was the time when I was praying for my life throughout the taxi ride, because the driver was cruising it at a super speed, uncomfortably jerking the car in twists and turns on the slightest of bends. All this, despite my protests and requests. I guess threats would have been a better option. I\u2019ve had my fair share of rude taxi drivers, which makes me swear each time that I\u2019m never going by taxi again. The most recent one was when the driver had reached but not to the exact location. I tried to explain to him where to come, but he refused and said, \u201cCome if you want, but if you don\u2019t then I\u2019m leaving.\u201d And he hung up. I had to walk several blocks to find him parked there, and I did give him a piece of my mind. But at the end of the day, I really wish I didn\u2019t have to deal with blockheads like him at all! The other half of the story is that most of the times it\u2019s a smooth ride and the drivers are polite (even if they don\u2019t know directions, which is the alarmingly common case nowadays). I wish it were like that all the time. After having several unpleasant incidents on taxis, it makes me cringe to even think about requesting the next one. It makes me almost decide to start driving. But then I cringe at the thought of reckless stunt drivers on the road, and parking hassles. So what do you think? To drive or not to drive? Assuming the pros and cons are present in both, the cons are cringeworthy in both. The pros of driving are that you are the master of your own time and vehicle. You can plan ahead of events and traffic hassles to reach in time. You have the freedom to move around and search places, or change plans accordingly. What do you think? Is driving more stressful? And would you consider switching to taxis or alternate commute to avoid driving stress? And what are some ways to practically improve driving in Qatar? Increasing parking spaces everywhere is one.

The announcement comes on the heels of letters sent to potential customers notifying them of their application status to purchase the car. The additional production supports the recent decision by Ford Performance to race Ford GT in both IMSA and World Endurance Championship (WEC) series events for four years. \"While we can\u2019t build enough Ford GTs for everyone who has applied, we are going to produce additional vehicles in an effort to satisfy more of our most loyal Ford ambassadors,\" says Dave Pericak, global director, Ford Performance. \"We want to keep Ford GT exclusive, but at the same time we know how vital this customer is to our brand.\" Year three of production will support applicants who were placed on the wait list; previously deferred applicants and those who missed the initial application window will be served by production year four. The application process for fourth-year production will reopen in early 2018. Those who already applied to own the car will only need to update their request. \"Ford GT has racing in its blood,\" says Raj Nair, Ford executive vice president, product development, and chief technical officer. \"The road car and race car will live on, side-by-side, for the next four years \u2013 providing ample opportunity to test and prove innovative new technologies both on and off the track.\""}

They are better off in the garden, according to research by Dutch academics. Women live longer as a result of domestic chores but they have no similar effect on men. However, this is probably because women do more housework, say the researchers\u00a0 The team from University Medical Centre Rotterdam found that a 55-year-old woman who does little around the house is likely to live to see her 83rd birthday \u2013 but that those who keep on top of the housework should live on to the age of 86.

But he cannot transfer the current residence permit before completing his 2 or 5 years contract without NOC even if it is unlimited period contract. New Law Brief Qatar Ministry of labor has done preparation for the new rule and regulations of the labor laws related to entry and Exit of Expatriates and this will starts implementation from\u00a013th of December of year 2016. These Changes really transform lives of common worker in Qatar as this laws totally convert kafala system to Contract based System. Everything written in contract is applicable rest of the things were deducted. Executive regulations are bye-laws that explain each article of a law and explain in detail how they are to be put in force. The law (Number 21 of 2015) regulating the entry, exit and residency of foreign workers was issued late last year, amending a previous legislation. Law\u00a0Number 21 of 2015, which abolishes the stipulations of Law Number 4 of 2009 regarding Regulation of the Expatriates Entry, Departure, Residence and Sponsorship, was issued on October 27 last year. Among other changes, the new law abolishes the\u00a0current two-year ban\u00a0on expatriates who want to come back to the country on a new visa. Presently it requires a no-objection certificate from the previous employer for a former resident to take up a new job in Qatar. The new legislation will replace the sponsorship system and make the employment and stay of expatiates here entirely contract-based. Job contract will need to be signed by a foreign worker before he lands here once the new law is in effect from later this year. Also, employment contracts of all expatriate workers who are already here will be replaced with new contracts. In other words, all expatriate workers will have to sign new contracts with their employers in compliance with the provisions of the new law (No 21 of 2015). \u201cSince the new law abolishes kafala (sponsorship system), a person who had previously worked in Qatar would not have to seek the approval of his former sponsor if he is recruited by a new employer,\u201d Brigadier Mohamed Ahmed al-Atiq, assistant-director general of the Department of Border, Passport and Expatriates Affairs, had said while explaining the salient features of the new law. \u201cA foreign worker who has got a new contract to work in Qatar can come back even the next day, provided he has met the other requirements like visa,\u201d he had said. This contract will form the basis of the relationship between a foreign worker and his employer. The contract will be signed for two or five years\u2019 duration and both the sides will be obliged to follow its clauses that will contain terms and conditions. Once the new law is in effect, the exit permit system whereby a foreign worker needs written permission from his sponsor to travel overseas will also end. A worker would only need to inform his employer about his departure. According to Article 26 of the new law, if a foreign worker is fired as a punitive measure and he did not appeal his dismissal or his plea was rejected by a court, he shall not be permitted to come back to Qatar before the passage of four years. Also, an expatriate worker repatriated upon a court verdict cannot come back unless he got the approval of the Minister of Interior. According to the new law, expatriate workers can change jobs with government permission, either after the expiry of their contracts or after five years of service with their employer in case of open-ended contracts. For changing of jobs before the expiry of contract, the new law stipulates that the expatriate worker has to get the approval of the employer, alongside the concerned government entities. The new law also enables expatriate workers to apply exit permits themselves through the approved channels of the Ministry of Interior, without having to seek the permission of the employer.

Thankyou", "commentId": "comment-7409061"}], "question": "Replacing lost identification documents can be a pain in the neck. You won't expect it to happen but when it happens it happens. A QLer recently shared his experience and the steps he had to go through to replace his residency card (Qatar ID). You may or may not go through the exact same steps depending on your visa type.\u00a0 \u00a0 The following steps particularly apply to those under a  visa. However, the procedure for replacing a lost residency card (Qatar ID) is almost similar across all visa types.\u00a0 1. Take a copy of the lost Qatar ID (if available) and the original passport of ID holder along with the original ID of the sponsor. If you do not have a copy of the lost ID, you will at least need the Qatar ID numbers. 2. Head over to one of the Immigration Service Centers (Gharrafa, Mesaimeer, Rayyan) during morning hours starting 7am and ideally before noon. Apparently they do not process lost Qatar IDs in the afternoon. SURPRISE!! 3. Go to the lost ID section and submit the documents there. They will process your request for a replacement and give you a document in Arabic. 4. Now take a token from the issuing counter. You will be summoned to the \"Lost ID\" counter 5. You will be charged QAR200 for replacing a Qatar ID. They don't accept cash so you will need a debit/credit card. : If you're sponsored by a company, you will need a NOC in Arabic (a letter requesting for replacement) from the company. You do NOT require a police report for Qatar ID replacement."}

In my last five years of driving, I have noticed that a lot of drivers on the road (including expats) expect all other cars to move over as per their convenience and at his desired speed. The roads must be open for him/her and has no courtesy to give way to fellow drivers despite knowing that there's ongoing constructions every where.The large SUVs think it's their right to honk at each and every person on road. All though I encourage the use of horn when appropriate to avoid danger but their use must not become a fashion such as flashing the lights which has already become one. I have also seen number of drivers getting involved in road rages because of using unnecessary horns because you probably don't know who you're honking at. Rant over.

But what about regular middle-income expats, or even higher-salaried ones? Everyone has rights, and NHRC is here to ensure that your rights are taken care of. The National Human Rights Committee (NHRC) is a government-appointed human rights commission based in the State of Qatar. Established in 2002, it has been tasked with the responsibility of overseeing and carrying out investigations on human rights abuses in the country. The commission's aims revolve around raising awareness of human rights abuses, monitoring and observing human rights abuses, and empowering individuals. Their means of advancing this goal include contributing to research programs related to human rights, conducting studies and providing advice and recommendations to legislative bodies. The NHRC also advocates for the rights of individuals with disabilities. Expat life in Qatar is not without its problems, and while a lot of people do not, or are too scared to avail NHRC services, this organization has come to the rescue of a large number of expats and migrant workers. Be it employment issues, payment problems, or any thing that can be classified as human rights' violations, the NHRC does its due diligence in ensuring that all needs are met. For those who are wondering, you do not have to file any official complaints, and the NHRC is available just for a consultation as well. You can walk in during their operating hours from 7am \u2013 1pm and ask them or discuss whatever your problems might be. The men's section is usually crowded, and the wait might be longer, however the ladies section is fairly free, and the staff addressing your issues will be women as well. There is no fee and services are provided free of charge. They also do not ask for any personal information like ID card number, passport etc, while discussing your troubles. If you think you are in trouble, do not hesitate to reach out to them. NHRC might be the best option for you, to get any kind of help in resolving the situation you are in. The NHRC is located in Markhiya and Fereej AbdulAziz areas."}

There's a huge difference between network marketing and pyramid schemes. Learn the truth here. Q: Some friends continue to try to recruit me into network marketing deals that seem like some type of money game or pyramid. Other friends tell me they're illegal and I'll get into trouble. How do I know what's legal and legitimate? A: To help you understand what network marketing is, I must first explain what it isn't. First, network marketing isn't a pyramid scheme. Pyramids are programs similar to chain letters where people just invest money based on the promise that other people will put in money that will filtrate back to them and somehow, they'll get rich. A pyramid is strictly a money game and has no basis in real commerce. Normally, there's no product involved at all, just money changing hands. Modern-day pyramids may have a product, but it's clearly there just to disguise the money game. Network marketing is a legitimate business. First, it's based on providing people with real, legitimate products they need and want at a fair price. While some people do make a lot of money through network marketing, their financial benefit is always the result of their own dedicated efforts in building an organization that sells real products and services. Pyramids are illegal and are based on taking advantage of people. For a person to actually make money in a pyramid scheme, someone else has to lose money. But in network marketing, each person can multiply his or her efforts, skills and talents by helping others be successful. Network marketing has proved itself as part of the new economy and a preferred way to do business here and around the world. Network marketing isn't about taking advantage of your friends and relatives. Only a few years ago, network marketing meant retailing to, and sponsoring people from, your \"warm list\" of prospects. Although sharing the products or services and the opportunity with people you know is still the basic foundation of the business, today we see more people using sophisticated marketing techniques such as the Internet, conference calling and other long-distance sponsoring techniques to extend their network across the country. Network marketing isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. Of course some people do make large amounts of money very quickly. Many would say those people are lucky. But success in networking isn't based on luck. (Unfortunately, money won't sprout wings and fly into your bank account no matter what someone has promised you.) Success in network marketing is based on following some very basic yet dynamic principles. Now let's discuss what network marketing is. Network marketing is a serious business for serious people. It's a proven system where the design, creation and expense the corporate team has gone through becomes a road map for your own success. Just follow the simple, proven and duplicable system that the good companies provide. The real key is this: Network marketing is all about leverage. You can leverage your time and increase the number of hours of work effort on which you can be paid by sponsoring other people and earning a small income on their efforts. J. Paul Getty, who created one of the world's greatest fortunes, said \"I would rather make 1 percent on the efforts of 100 people than 100 percent on my own efforts.\" This very basic concept is the cornerstone of network marketing. For example, most successful people building a network marketing business do so in an organized method. They work a few dedicated hours each week, with each hour of effort serving as a building block for their long-term business growth. Then they sponsor other people and teach those people how to sell the company product and sponsor others who duplicate the process. By helping the people you personally sponsor to sponsor others, you duplicate yourself. As this process continues, you create compound growth that can lead to hundreds or even thousands of people coming into your business. You leverage your time by helping others be successful and earn an income from all their efforts. With network marketing, there are no big capital requirements, no geographical limitations, no minimum quotas required and no special education or skills needed. Network marketing is a low-overhead, homebased business that can actually offer many of the tax advantages associated with owning your own business. Network marketing is a people-to-people business that can significantly expand your circle of friends. It's a business that enables you to travel and have fun as well as enjoy the lifestyle that extra income can provide. Michael L.

Helpful to many", "commentId": "comment-7418876"}], "question": "Hello Everyone, I\u2019m writing this post regarding the VISIT VISA and then RESIDENT PERMIT for Family (Wife). I know there is no particular website or detailed information regarding the same available anywhere and I did a lot of research and got different feedback and opinions and when I final got my wife RP, I felt I had to pen down the detailed steps along with the documents which will be helpful for a newbie applying for the same. VISIT VISA Visit visa is general issued for a validity of 1 month which can be extended up to 6 months incl. of the 1st month validity. The time taken to get a visit visa varies as per service centers (I compared time between me and my friend) and generally it takes 2-4 working days if all the documentation is proper. Please do download Metrash 2 and register yourself for the same. This is very helpful as you get all the updates through this app. Documents required: 1. Self-Qatar ID (Front & Back Side) Copy. 2. Passport Copy of Wife or Other Family Member. 3. NOC from Employer (Stating your full name and profession as per QID, also mentioned about visit visa for wife and also salary, if more than QAR 7000 then it\u2019s better) 4. Company computer card (to verify authorized signatory). 5. Attested Marraige Certificate (QAR 300) 6. Visit visa application form duly filled in Arabic. (https://www.moi.gov.qa/site/english/departments/PassportDept/resources/2011/03/17_21086.pdf) Procedure: 1. Take a token number and then Submit all the required at any of the service centers. (I submitted all the documents at Al Dayyan Service Center in Shanaiya-Al Khor Road). 2. They will verify the documents on the spot and if any document is missing they will tell about the same and return all the documents. If everything is alright then they will take down your mobile number, give a receipt with a reference number (VB-2016-*****) and tell to wait for 2-3 days. 3. I got the visa ready message with 4 hrs and I was able to pay the fees by metrash on the same night. 4. Once you pay the fees, download the visa from https://portal.moi.gov.qa/wps/portal/MOIInternet/services/inquiries/visaservices/enquiryandprinting MEDICAL FOR VISIT VISA EXTENSION Assuming that you have already got the visit visa and your family is here in Qatar. 1. Once they arrive here within a month time, preferably with 15-20 days get the medical done for your family from Medical Commission. 2. Just take the original passport, visa copy and along with your QID with phone number written on it. Go to medical commission (Enter Main Gate and Take a Right, 2 Building is for Family) 3. You need to pay 100 QAR per person and they accept only Credit/Debit card. If you don\u2019t have any of them, then no issues in the waiting area they have an official were they issue cash cards with a minimal extra fees. 4. After the medical is done, which generally takes less time but it also depends on the number of people there, prefer to go after 3pm. Just wait for the message which generally takes 2-3 days. 5. Once message is received, you can log into metrash and pay 200 QAR per month i.e. 1000 QAR for 5 months. VISIT VISA to RESIDENT PERMIT This process is also simply but just needs to roam around a bit. If your 6 months bank statements (4-5 months is also fine) is ready then no need to get the visit visa extended for 6 months. Documents Required 1. Self-Qatar ID (Front & Back Side) Copy. 2. Passport Copy of Wife or Other Family Member. 3. NOC from Employer (Stating your full name and profession as per QID, also mentioned about resident visa for wife and also salary, if more than QAR 10,000 then it\u2019s better) 4. Company computer card (to verify authorized signatory). 5. Family Visa application form duly filled in Arabic. (https://www.moi.gov.qa/site/english/departments/PassportDept/resources/2011/03/17_21085.pdf). 6. 6 Months back statement signed and stamped by bank (Commercial Bank: you can just walk into any branch and ask for 6 months statement for visa of family member and they charges 10 QAR per Month statement i.e. 60 QAR). This is general a single paper where it shows your salary credited date and salary. They salary should be more than 10,000 QAR. 7. Tenancy contract with Baladiya attestation (Go to Al Saad Baladiya office for tenancy attestation and if you go in the morning, it takes hardly 15 mins and they charge 1% of your annual rent). 8. Copy of Your Attested Degree certificate and Arabic Translation. 9.\u00a0Attested Marraige Certificate. 10. Employment contract (this you will get from the company and it should be attested by labor department, its company\u2019s responsibility to get it done and nowadays they are putting a barcode on the contract). Procedure: 1. Take all the documents and head to Gharaffa Immigration department, go directly to building 4 and take a token number and submit all your documents. They will verify the documents on the spot and if any document is missing they will tell about the same and return all the documents. If everything is alright then they will take down your mobile number, give a receipt with a reference number and tell to wait for 2-3 days. 2. Once you get a message that your visa is ready, head again to Gharaffa Immigration department and head to building 1, handover the receipt received previously and don\u2019t forget to tell them \u201cCONVERTING VISIT VISA TO RP and FAMILY ALREADY IN QATAR\u201d. First you have to pay 200 QAR for new visa and then 500 QAR for with exit permit conversion fees. They will give 2 receipts and do keep them safe for further use. 3. Now head to medical commission again with the family member along with passport and the receipt received in the previous step and once they go inside tell them to inform in the counter about conversion and they will send to various rooms in the same building and then pay 100 QAR for converting visit visa medical to RP medical. You will receive a message immediately about Medical test being OK. Keep the receipt received here for further use. 4. Get 1 photograph with blue background (but they don\u2019t seriously check that) and also get Blood Group test done (I did this is Apollo, they charge 20 QAR for just the blood group test and give the report in 3-4 hours). 5. Go to https://portal.moi.gov.qa/wps/portal/MOIInternet/services/inquiries/residencypermits/rpapplicationtracking , enter visa number which is on the receipt received in step 2 and your QID number. You will get an application, fill it with the required details i.e. passport issue date, blood group, nationality, profession etc. and also card validity i.e. 1 year (500 QAR), 2 years (850 QAR) and 3 years (1050 QAR). Not exactly sure about the fees of 2 and 3 years as I got 1 year duration. 6. Take the print out of the application form duly filled, then stick photo and sign with a black pen. This photo and signature will be reflected on the family member QID. 7. Head to Mesammier Service Center (Timing 6am to 1 pm & 3pm to 7pm) for Finger print (guess there is one more on Salwa road), send the family member inside the finger print room along with filled application form, blood test report, visa receipt of step 2 and medical receipt of step 3. They will get the finger print done and just tick on the back side of the application form and give back all the documents back. 8. Wait for 2-3 days for the finger print OK message. But it generally take 1 day. I got it on the same day night. 9. Final step, take the application form, visa receipt, medical receipt and head to any nearest service center. I went to Mesammier, take a token and submit all the documents and pay the required fees which depends on the tenure of QID, I paid 500 QAR for 1 year and they will tell to wait for 10 mins. Once done they will hand over the new QID, btw no need of taking family member here. PS: If you\u2019re getting resident visa directly without visit visa then you don\u2019t need to pay the extra 500 QAR which is paid for non-exit from country. Btw I got bought my visa on visit visa and then after 5 months I converted to RP as I had to wait for the bank statements. If you already have the bank statements, no need of extending the visit visa, just apply for RP before it gets expired and you will be saving 1000 QAR. Fees Paid: 1. Visit Visa (1 Month) \u2013 200 QAR. 2. Medical Test \u2013 100 QAR. 3. Visit Visa (Extension) \u2013 1000 QAR. 4. Baladiya (1% of Annual Rent) \u2013 700 QAR. 5. Resident Visa \u2013 200 QAR. 6. Non-Exit Fees \u2013 500 QAR 7. Medical Test \u2013 100 QAR. 8. Blood Test & Photo \u2013 20 QAR + 25 QAR. 9. RP (1 year) \u2013 500 QAR. 10. Marraige Certificate Attestation - 350 QAR Hope this is helpful. Regards, Kiran"}

Will try it", "commentId": "comment-7422071"}], "question": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In an effort to woo more tourists, a local company plans to launch the first passenger and vehicle ferry between Qatar and Bahrain by the middle of next year. The new service will include two return trips a day from Al Ruwais port in northern Qatar to Khalifa bin Salman port in Bahrain and will take commercial as well as personal vehicles. This will be the first ferry service in recent years to run between Gulf countries, an industry source told Doha News. The service will be operated by the Qatari firm Gulf Ferry, with input from Doha-based Sora Marine Services. Shorter journey The launch of the ferry will likely be welcome news for truck drivers. It will also offer another route for tourists who want to explore the Gulf in their own vehicles. The trip is estimated to take some 1.5 to 2.5 hours, compared to the 4.5 hour journey time by land from Qatar to Bahrain. Driving there also currently involves crossing through Saudi Arabia. In the past, there has been repeated talk of building a Qatar-Bahrain causeway, but this has never come to fruition. If the ferry is successful, there are also plans to operate one from Qatar to the UAE, although there is no timeline for this yet. This much longer route would involve an overnight crossing and so would use different vessels from those operating the Bahrain-to-Qatar trips. How it will work One boat has already been lined up to operate the route, with another soon to follow, the industry source told Doha News. Each vessel will have a capacity of around 50 vehicles and can hold approximately 100 passengers at a time. The \u201cro-pax\u201d ferries allow vehicles to be driven straight onto and off of a dedicated deck. There will also be separate passenger facilities. But the interior configuration of the vessels is still being confirmed, the source added. Rumors of the new ferry began circulating on social media in Qatar last weekend. A representative for Sora Marine Services confirmed to Doha News that preparations for the project were \u201congoing,\u201d and said full details of the service would be revealed early next year. Exact timings for the service have not yet been confirmed, he added. New routes At least one shipping company in Abu Dhabi has previously talked about launching an intra-Gulf ferry line, but has not officially confirmed anything to date. A commercial ferry used to run between Qatar and Iran, but this route ended several years ago. The first phase of Al Ruwais port was officially inaugurated by Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister early last year. It\u2019s part of a plan to increase trade in the region, Qatar Ports Management Company (Mwani Qatar) said at the time. The new land route would make it easier to transport goods between the two countries, while also opening up opportunities for tourists. Attracting more visitors to Qatar from neighboring Gulf states is a crucial part of Qatar\u2019s developing tourism industry. Nearly half of all visitors here during the first half of the year came from GCC countries. Qatar is also keen to encourage more people to travel by sea to explore its attractions, including on the cruise circuit. The World was the first of this season to dock here last month. Around 32 vessels are expected to come to Qatar between October and April 2017. Would you take a ferry to Bahrain? Thoughts? \u00a0 Source:http://dohanews.co/first-qatar-to-bahrain-ferry-service-to-launch-next-year/"}

We give you a few ideas of fun and adventurous things you can do for a day in Qatar. How many have you tried? \u00a0 Sealine Resort has jet skis for rent, and Al Bandar as well. However, make sure you don\u2019t do this by yourself, especially if you are a beginner. Jet Ski rentals in Sealine have instructors as well. \u00a0 Dune buggies are a lot of fun, although dangerous if not done properly. If you are a beginner, it is advisable to stay on the ground itself, and only climb small mounds. You can rent dune buggies in Sealine beach. Costs vary depending on who you rent from, but an average of 100 QR per half hour is common. \u00a0 A lot of people who have lived in Doha for years haven\u2019t actually tried going on a dhow. You do have the gaudy but fun looking dhows which take you on a 20 minute ride towards West Bay and back to the Corniche. However, if you\u2019re looking for something more than that, a dhow costs you roughly QR 3000 for around 6 hours. Drive around Al Bandar, and you will find lots of dhows for rent. \u00a0 A few years back, you could rent a bicycle in Aspire and ride around. Aspire park, being super beautiful and scenic, makes a unique and interesting cycle track. However, we were not able to confirm if cycling is still allowed and renting a bike is possible currently. If you know, let us know in the comments. \u00a0 Driving a 4x4 is not a luxury in Qatar, it\u2019s a necessity, according to some, and is now ingrained in the local culture. In case you are one of those people who don\u2019t own one of your own, it\u2019s actually pretty easy to get one on rent. Rent a 4x4 and venture out to explore Doha, on road and more importantly, off road. And if you have any experience \u2013 the sand dunes in Sealine are calling out to you. A Nissan Patrol costs roughly QR 500 for a day, prices vary depending on where you are renting it from of course. If you have any more suggestions, let us know in the comments."}

And the great part about all these options \u2013 they are free of cost. So scratch the gym memberships, and paid fitness sessions, for cutting those calories while breathing some fresh air, especially now that the weather in Doha is so perfect. Aspire Zone is a great location for any sporting activity \u2013 whether you want to go for a walk, or play basketball, volleyball and football. They have a massive landscaped park area, which is beautiful in the day, but even better at night. They have outdoor exercise machines located on two sides of the park and running or jogging tracks that have really soft tarmac. Not only is it safe for kids, but also a great option for families and adults, as it presents views of the Torch tower, while you gaze at the beautiful lake, albeit artificial, in the middle of the park. Added bonus \u2013 really cute ducks too! The park has two cafes \u2013 for a well-deserved break, and the best part is the surrounding greenery. They also have basketball courts and football grounds \u2013 not too large of course \u2013 but completely free of charge and open for anyone to use within their opening hours. The Corniche is also great, for many reasons. The beautiful lit views of West Bay in the horizon never gets old, and motivates you to keep walking amid all the bright city lights. With the sea right next to you, the sound of waves and the sights of traditional dhows, Corniche presents a great option for a walk. If walking or running is not your thing, at least make it to their outdoor exercise area, where they have lots of cardio equipment for the public to use for free.\u00a0 Either side you walk, you have the MIA park \u2013 known for its great views and landscape, and Costa Coffee towards the other end, where you get a closer look of the beautiful Doha skyline. Time to get some exercise! Do you have any other recommendations for outdoor workout areas? Let us know in the comments."}

In my personal opinion, the writer looks for experimentation than a freedom. First of all what is a freedom: In my view freedom is someone would able to participate, talk, feel, enjoy etc., as long as it comes under legal terms. (The legal term may work together with religious aspirations, depend upon the country and family back round) If I elaborate further, for an example One of my previous Manager sent His kid for an International College here in Doha, and sent His Arabic speaking Purchasing manager accompany His kid during registration. He did this because the manager is from Asia, and He may felt from His previous experience the acceptance of the Purchasing manager at the college better than going by himself. This is incident reflect a discrimination. I would say In a way of losing freedom. Btw: This can happen Vice Versa as well. (Example a European traveler traveling in another country and if he may played out for different misunderstanding, and He really some time doesn\u2019t have the option of winning back, This also a way of lacking freedom) in a foreign country. As far as I concern, the Qatari population in Doha have the best of freedom under legal and religious term. If you talk about experimentation, yes it may not there. Yes, the person can go out of the country to experiment the other culture and living condition under their legal terms. Absolutely this article is not about a personal freedom for sure. In my village if they see a child they will ask who is your father. This gives certain understanding of who is He. I am not insisting here the child should be exactly like a father or not. But it\u2019s a general measuring term in those villages.

Most of the expats who move here leave their families and relatives behind. The most prevalent practice of married expats is that of bringing their nuclear families over to Qatar. A nuclear family is a household that consists of husband, wife and kids. I remember that we studied in school about this social phenomenon. Nuclear families replace extended families once they move from rural areas to urban cities. And this is common knowledge that this usually happens when a society starts becoming more industrialized and moves towards technological progress.  But it\u2019s not just about economy; civil wars can also transform the family structure from extended to nuclear ones. That is not really an option when people become refugees. Furthermore, occupation, ethnic cleansing and other crimes against humanity can also transform many extended families into nuclear ones.  I have been seeing Arabs and expats from all over the world coming to Qatar without their grandmothers and grandfathers. All the nuclear families I've came across in Qatar are mainly from mixed races and multicultural backgrounds from around the world.  When I was a kid, I couldn't imagine how I would return one day from school and not have lunch with my grandmother, then head over to the backyard to water and talk to the palm trees, and on Fridays go to the fish market and head over to the butcher before the\u00a0Friday\u00a0prayer.  Extended families usually thrive and survive when you have elders living with you. They act as the focal point which attracts all of their children, grandchildren and cousins.  As much as I love this aspect, it does feel invasive to me at times. The flip side of the coin is, it can be overwhelming sometimes. There are certain situations where I don\u2019t think I can tolerate it any more, because relatives start asking me personal questions. Whenever this scenario occurs, my mind races to concepts of individuality and self-expression. I long for the freedom of finding and expressing oneself fully in such an environment.  There are many situations where I would tell my expat friends (adults) how lucky they are because don\u2019t live in a society that has its roots in extended families and gives relatives more reign over each other\u2019s lives. An expat is less likely to be told what or what not to do since they left their families behind (nuclear or extended).  I need to clarify that I love my family very much, and I can't even imagine leaving them forever. I love my roots and have the utmost respect for them. But I do want to experience individuality at some point in my life. I want to be truly independent.  It can be a suffocating ordeal to think, speak and act according to what expectations an extended family has set for you. I crave to go on an adventure at some point in my life and see what other cultures have to offer. I want to come back and combine what I learned with my culture and maybe introduce aspects that blend well with my roots here."}

I graduated from school in January, and thought that I would have more time to spend with my friends to discuss more than just assignments, professors and topics related to what we were studying. I was looking forward to spending more quality time with them, now that we were free from study responsibilities. Unfortunately, the people that I had emotionally invested in are all gone. The people that I used to sit with at one table in a restaurant, have all scattered to different parts of the world. Some people would say that I was na\u00efve to expect my friends to keep staying in Qatar, and our relationship would stay the same forever. They would say that I should have known this before making friends who are not local and would eventually move out of Qatar. Maybe that is true; but, for the longest time it was not really in my control to create friendships with expats; it happens organically. Demographically speaking, I live in Doha, which is a very cosmopolitan city and the likelihood of making friends who are not local is pretty high. This is the reality of living in Doha. One of the people whom I really love and respect decided to move out of Qatar. And I asked, \u201cWhat is Qatar to you?\u201d The reply was, \u201cQatar is a transit station\u201d. I was smiling on the outside but was hurt inside. I\u2019m not hurt because the person is leaving Qatar, but due to the fact that because of this friend leaving, staying in touch in the same way will be difficult. The truth is, that the possibility of maintaining direct communication is difficult, no matter how easy technology has made it to be in touch with our loved ones. I feel I can no longer take the time to invest in friendships that only last a limited period of time. When these friends leave it means that I need to exert effort to keep in touch with them, and if the communication stops, I am constantly worrying about them. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I would love to make new friends; but I feel burnt out after so many farewells to good friends. And I just don\u2019t feel I could face all that again. I know that what I\u2019ve said is a bit negative. And I\u2019ll probably continue making friends at some point who are expats and will not be in Qatar forever. But honestly, there is a bright side to all of this. In a period of just 5 years I have made friends who are now living in the UK, Germany, India, Pakistan, Bahrain and Tanzania (which is supposedly somewhere in Africa). I still do not have a clue If I\u2019ll be able to continue being in touch if the list expands. I feel confused sometimes because some of them are not in touch with me anymore. I know for sure that no money in this world can bring back the day when I had all of my 5 friends watching shooting stars in Fuwarit beach at 2 am in the morning.\u00a0"}

Don't mix business with pleasure! Trying to have pleasure out of your work is fine but don't expect it always to be this way, as nobody is going to pay you to have fun! If it was fun no one would be paying you to do it! Understanding this and accepting this mere fact would help you develop drastically on the professional level. You will start to get out of the trap that always young programmers fill in. I did fall into it myself! You start to underestimate your value to your company and start accepting \"compensation\" in form of more work! Instead of benefits or money! Yes, that is true! You work for money! Not for the glory of typing amazing code! We are in the business of making money! The more you realize this, the more successful you will become! If you really wish to have fun coding then try starting your own projects on the side where you can pick and choose which technology to use, put your own design and architecture, learn for real! But don't expect your work place to do this for you! They just want you to do what they paid you to do!

So carry on having 4 - 5 cups of tea without any fear ..............", "commentId": "comment-7164161"}], "question": "Several days back a QLer had posted a query seeking advice on the problem of urinary incontinence. I have come across some information on the issue and decided to share it with other QLers. Possibly, the information may be of help. Urinary incontinence can be an embarrassing problem, and it is far from being uncommon. While it is more often associated with the elderly, it can actually happen at any stage in life. Urinary Incontinence Types and Causes: The problem is more often associated with women, especially during pregnancy or menopause. It arises when there is a lot of internal pressure in the bladder. These are the different types of urinary incontinence: \u2022 Urgent Incontinence Usually accompanied by the urge to urinate, this type of urinary incontinence happens when the sensory impulses in the walls of the bladder don\u2019t react in time. \u2022 Overflowing Incontinence This occurs when the bladder is stretched from being full of urine, which can be caused by a number of factors, such as urethra blockage, prostate enlargement in men or neurological damage to spine caused by a spinal cord injury, surgery or multiple sclerosis. \u2022 Psychogenic Incontinence Feeling fear, anxiety, mania or being exposed to something phobic are all causes of this type of incontinence. \u2022 Neurological Incontinence Changes to the nervous system caused by a stroke, Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries or other ailments result in changes in urinary function, and thus incontinence. Homemade Urinary Incontinence Remedies: Here are four tonic recipes for urinary incontinence that you may try at home: Recipe 1 \u2022 2 tbsp. fennel \u2022 1 cup water Directions Boil the fennel in the water for five minutes and leave to cool. Once cooled, drink the mixture. Do this once a day. Recipe 2 \u2022 1 handful raspberry leaves \u2022 1 cup water Directions Boil the raspberry leaves in the water for five minutes and leave to cool. Once cooled, drink the mixture. Repeat once per day. This remedy is particularly good for those looking to strengthen their pelvic muscles. Recipe 3 \u2022 1 garlic bulb \u2022 1 handful white hawthorn flowers \u2022 2 liters water Directions Crush the garlic and combine with the hawthorn flowers in the water. Boil and leave to brew for 15 minutes. Next, strain the mixture, add it to a bathtub filled with warm water, and bathe in it. Recipe 4 \u2022 1 tbsp. bearberry leaves \u2022 1 liter tea Combine the tea and bearberry leaves. Drink a cup once every three hours, no more than five times each day. Note that those who have kidney inflammation should not try this remedy. Urinary Incontinence Tips and Techniques In addition to the recipes outlined above, there are various things you can do to ease your urinary incontinence: \u2022 Take Warm Sitz Baths While taking a sitz bath, try sitting down, contracting your pelvic muscles and holding for five seconds. Relax for 10 seconds, and then repeat. Do this exercise 10 times in succession each day. \u2022 Do Kegel Exercises When you are urinating, try contracting your pubococcygeus muscle by stemming the flow of urine. Repeat this process several times until your bladder is empty. Limit yourself to doing this exercise a maximum of three times per month. \u2022 Do Hypo pressure Exercises Stand with your leg a hip\u2019s width apart, bringing your pelvis forward. Then, bend your knees slightly and raise your palms. Contract your abdomen three times using short breaths. Exhale each breath slowly. Repeat this process twice. \u2022 Figure out What\u2019s Causing Your Incontinence If you\u2019re stressed out, anxious or happen to have a urinary tract infection, you need to remedy those things first in order for your incontinence to be treated in turn. \u2022 Don\u2019t Reduce Your Fluid Intake Although it might seem to make sense to reduce the amount of water you\u2019re drinking, it isn\u2019t such a good idea, because doing so could lead to dehydration and kidney problems. \u2022 Lose Weight Obesity is associated with many different health problems, and incontinence is one of them. Its relation to incontinence is that it does not allow a person\u2019s muscles, including the pelvis, to contract properly. Avoid These Foods: Tomato sauce, chocolate, corn syrup, sugars, honey, chili pepper, curry and other very sweet or spicy foods should be avoided, as they can irritate your bladder. Also avoid tea, coffee and soft drinks. Prevention: Take preventative measures, such as going to the bathroom before sleeping at night. If you\u2019re also sneezing, coughing or have to lift something heavy, try tightening your pubococcygeus muscle to prevent urine leaking out.Furthermore, make sure you use the bathroom before you leave home and wear underwear that\u2019s easy to take off. Keep a spare pair with you. Last but not least, if you need to go, go \u2013 don\u2019t hold your bladder, as this may lead to an infection or weakened sphincter muscle."}

{"subject": "Activity clubs in Qatar", "username": "Haashmie Doha", "topic": "socialising", "question": "Have you moved to Qatar recently and are wondering how to while away time in the best possible ways? Before I moved to Qatar I had already started searching ways to keep busy once here, by examining everything under the Qatari sun (under the Qatar based websites to be precise). Qatar Living was my primary source of information and inspiration, gently nudging me to pursue my interests. My journey led me to join several activity clubs, volunteering at a school, finding and nurturing my favorite hobby, becoming a part of an enterprising team, meeting wonderful people from different cultures and cultivating friendships with beautiful souls. All this was easily achieved once I found the arrows pointing in the direction of my interests. If you are still wondering where those arrows are, here are a few to get you started on your journey. Discover Qatar is Qatar Airway\u2019s tourism facilitating company that provides tours and holiday packages. The tours include Doha Express City Tour, Half Day Desert Safari, Museum Tours, Zekreet/West Coast Tour, Arabian Night Safari, Souq Waqif Dinner Tour, Qatar Explorer Tour, Full Day Safari with BBQ, Islamic Mosque and Cultural Tour of Qatar, Grand Doha Tour, Qatar Cultural Tour. These tours are especially recommended for new arrivals to get a hands-on experience of the culture and environment in Qatar. \u00a0 Entalek is an eco-adventure organization that has been arranging exciting tours in some of Qatar\u2019s best kept secrets since 2011. Communing with nature while having fun is the aim of Entalek. They provide kayaking and paddling packages for families and groups. Their adventures come across as exploring the wonders of nature while relaxing at the mangroves of Al Thakhira. Safaris and hiking tours are also offered by the company This organization caters to the new and the old residents and tourists of Qatar alike. Their mission is to welcome everyone into the Qatari culture by providing experiences directly embedded in the traditions of this region. Their professionals possess full knowledge on the subject and provide guidance on the Qatari culture, traditions, values, principles, and visions of future growth. One of the very first networks I joined in Qatar was this club. I was amazed at the elegance and opulence of their events that were always well-organized. The opulence lies in the versatility of the members as well. I was happy to meet women from all over the world, and each had a story to tell. These networking events proved to me how women are venturing out into world to make a difference with their entrepreneurship and leadership qualities. Sometimes when you move to a new place there are bouts of anxiety and confusion regarding the transition. For women who find themselves unable to maneuver their way in Doha soon after arriving here, they can find solace in a group created specifically for them. Qatar Expat Women was founded by an expatriate from United Kingdom, Carole Astin, when she moved to Doha. The goal of her group is to form a support group for women, who might otherwise be suffering from isolation after leaving behind families, social circle and friends in their home countries. With the successful turnout at events arranged through this group, more women are gravitating towards it and creating new bonds and friendships. The group arranges meetups, events, volunteering and tours that unite women from all cultures and give them a platform to feel totally at home in Qatar. There are numerous other clubs and activities available in Qatar catering to your needs and preferences. I have listed just a few that helped me in my journey in Qatar. You can join boating clubs like Doha Dragon Boat, or enroll yourself in one of the many community courses held regularly at Virginia Commonwealth University. I took two courses last year and have been able to create a small franchise out my hobby in the skill I learnt. We would love to hear your experiences with finding your passion in Qatar. Let us know how you fared in your quest for activities in Qatar!"}

The daily, quoting Hassan al-Muhammadi, head of the Communication Office at the SEC, said the penalties for offenders could be imprisonment up to six months and fines reaching QR100,000 or both. Officers of the SEC will have the judicial authority to deal with any offence in this regard. Al-Hassan said the measures are being taken to implement the new law for practicing of educational services in Qatar issued last September. He urged publishing houses and advertisement platforms to participate in the campaign by refusing to release any material that promotes and encourages private tuition. According to the new law, the SEC has the authority to approve educational centres and issue sanctions against those who practice without permission. \u201cUnauthorised private tutors will be targeted in the first phase of the drive,\u201d al-Muhammadi said. To curb the \u201cunhealthy\u201d practice, awareness campaigns through different media will be run to inform the residents about the new law, he said. The council has already started adding lessons and explanations on the SEC website so that students can study without the help of tutors. In addition, special classes will be conducted at the schools for students who need help in some of the subjects.

{"subject": "Royal Vet Clinic- dog spaying", "username": "poli00000", "topic": "socialising", "question": "I have a black papillon schipperke female dog, she was one year and two months, named Lucky Luca. She was a very special, and adorable dog. She become my best friend and we bonded on a high level, I wanted to do the best for my dog to live longer, so when I was searching I came to know that spaying is the best option for a dog if not intersted in breeding her, since 5 months I was hesitating to do it but when her heat was near i decided to do it, so I booked an apointment at royal vet clinic , when I took my dog there the receiptionest said the fees is 1000 Ryial (one thousand qatari ryials) for a female as I know it should be less than 1000 if the dog is under 10 kg , Luca was 4.5 kg. It was saturday 23-01-16 , receiptionest said we make discount the price is 900, then the vet came and asked about the breed and age, and I asked him when i can come to take her. He said you can come at 4 pm. At 12:40 I found 2 missed-calls from them, I called and the receiptionest said I will transfer you to the vet. In that moment I felt that there is something wrong. He said im sorry she didnt make it. I felt like the world went black i felt so bad and the first thing came to my mind is why and how. Any way i went to the vet he said during the surgery she went blue. And i have given her the normal amount of anesthesia, he said she may had kidney or liver problems although she was a very healthy dog, then i asked you didnt do any kind of test before the surgery? he said we dont do that. I tried my best. I didnt want to lose her body so i found some one who can do taxidermy same day of her death which she kept in freezer. He had some little experience with anatomy. He said her flesh was blue and smell bad. From his point of view that there was some carelessness in the operation. When the vet said while he was working then he notice she turn blue a question came to my mind that how come the machines didnt notify him while he was working of her heart rate or breath. If she turned blue while he was working means he didnt knw that she is dead till her body become blue. So i called another vet to ask if they do monitoring during the surgery they said yes we do like human operation fully equiped. Then i made a friend of mine to call the royal vet clinic to ask the vet. So the receptionist said the spay is 600 for female dog which they asked me for 1000 ryal then discounted to 900. But they didnt charge me after her death. So my friend ask the vet i want to spay my dog and i want to knw if you use any monitoring devices during the survery. Dr Leo said we dont use any monitors we do it manualy only. Then he asked whats the age and breed. My friend said husky 5 months. Dr said we do it only for under 3 months you can find another vet. His talk is very conflicting as he knew that luca is one year and he was speaking with fear. What kind of a vet perform a surgery with out monitors? i always assumed that this is the procedure for any operation, how he can give anesthesia and cut and work only with out monitoring? This is very careless, considered illegal and malpractice to any medical procedure and organic life. Now luca is gone and i wish if i didnt spay her. The reason im writing this is to becareful not to take your loving pet to any vet before making sure everything is equiped. Losing a loving pet is not easy, i cant get over her death and everyday i wish i went back in time and not taking her to that vet. She is my best friend and my baby in good and bad. I dont wish this to anyone. Please dont take your dog to this careless vet."}

It is a very common practice at restaurants for the middle income and low income people to ask for leftovers to be packed for taking away home. These lot of people value food and value money. This is because the middle and the low income people do not forget what they were taught at home on not wasting food. These people have grown up in a culture where the rule was to take on the plate only that which could be eaten.", "commentId": "comment-7315656"}, {"username": "britexpat", "comment": "I have never known anyone to waste sushi", "commentId": "comment-7315626"}], "question": "With food wastage becoming a serious problem in Qatar, some local restaurants have devised a creative way to get people to clean their plates \u2013 charging them for leftovers. That\u2019s the policy at the newly opened Maison De Sushi, a Japanese-Thai place at 01 Mall in Abu Hamour. The restaurant operates an all-day buffet menu, allowing customers to order unlimited amounts of food to their tables for set prices (QR80 or QR130/person). Once diners are done eating, they\u2019re charged QR5/per piece of food left on their plates. However, the restaurant is not a stickler about this rule, one manager told Doha News. \u201cWe don\u2019t always charge people because that\u2019s not the point of adding the rule. We don\u2019t want to penalize people. It\u2019s more about encouraging our guests to take extra care and not waste food,\u201d Nael Salaheddin said. Sometimes, the restaurant will even wrap up leftovers to be taken home. Maison De Sushi is not the first restaurant in Doha to impose a fee for wasting food. Yee Hwa, a Korean/Japanese restaurant in Al Sadd, has long charged customers QR5 for each piece of food left behind during its all-you-can-eat sushi nights. But the restaurant also is lax about the policy depending on how much food is left behind, a staffer told Doha News. Mixed reactions According to Salaheddin, some customers have found their fee amusing, while others have reacted with frustration and refuse to pay it. But the overwhelming majority of diners have lauded the rule, he added: \u201cWe see them coming back and always telling us that we\u2019re doing something great. Qataris have said \u2018God bless you\u2019 and shown a lot of appreciation.\u201d And most don\u2019t leave much food on their plates. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if this is because our food is too good, since I\u2019ve literally seen people licking the leftover sauce, or if it\u2019s because they really appreciate the rule,\u201d Salaheddin said. Food wastage in Qatar Qatar has one of the highest per capita food wastes in the world \u2013 up to 1.8kg per day. And discarded food accounts for more than half of Qatar\u2019s municipal garbage. Local researchers have called this practice \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cunsustainable,\u201d given that Qatar is a desert nation that imports 90 percent of what it eats. Academics from Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service in Qatar (GU-Q) are now leading a three-year study to investigate how much food is being thrown away here and why. Meanwhile, efforts are also underway to educate people on what it means to shop smartly and waste less. Would an extra charge stop you from wasting food? Thoughts?

Located at the Student Center in Education City, the bazaar has a great variety of local and non-local brands and businesses selling some really creative and unique items. The vendors are over 30 in number ranging from food, desserts, fashion, accessories, art and so much more. The bazaar is also great for families, with lots of children-friendly activities to watch or participate in like cupcake decorating, a ceramic painting station and even a live Turkish ice-cream display. There are small kiosks selling items of clothing, besides several others with hair accessories, jewellery and a seemingly popular make up stall. The make up stall features some of the popular international favourites like Anastasia Beverley Hills, Huda Beauty, Morphe and Kylie Cosmetics, among others. Accessory sales also include handmade ones by local artists like phone covers, gift items and several other interesting and unique things. A printing kiosk is also present, where they print items like mugs and T-Shirts on the spot. Stalls decorated with flowers, and beautiful arrangements are present as well. The bazaar is also teeming with food stalls, right from local Qatari cuisine to Indian and Pakistani. The dessert options are also several with ice creams, cakes, mini pancakes, cheesecakes and so much more. These include local Qatari and Arabic sweets too. Whether you are craving spicy kebabs, seafood or some machboos, you will pretty much find everything here, with good prices as well. What's interesting is that a lot of these stalls are serving fresh! Kids can rejoice because they have a dedicated ceramic painting area to unleash their creativity. The prices are mentioned at the bottom of the object and average at around QR 100. The entrance to the bazaar itself is free of charge, and open to the public. Timings: Thursday 11am \u2013 9pm Friday 3pm \u2013 9pm Saturday 3pm-9pm"}

Did you know that you might be able to get your next visa without an interview? If you have previously received a U.S. visa that expired and you are returning to the U.S. for the same purpose of travel, then you may qualify for the Interview Waiver Program (IWP). The Interview Waiver Program (IWP) allows qualified non-immigrant visa applicants to renew their tourist and business visas without having to come to the embassy for an interview. The Interview Waiver Program can make the application process faster and easier for those who have established a good travel history. Basically, the IWP allows you to skip the interview if you meet certain criteria. You may be eligible to participate in the Interview Waiver Program if: - You are a resident of Qatar - You are applying for a B1/B2 visa; - You have been issued a B1/B2 visa by U.S. Embassy Doha that was valid for at least 5 years; - You provided 10 fingerprints when you applied for your previous visa; and - Your visa has not been lost, stolen or revoked. Children under the age of 14 are also eligible to participate in the Interview Waiver Program if at least one of their parents has a B1/B2 visa issued by U.S. Embassy Doha that was valid for at least 5 years and still has remaining validity.

Things are not as very well organized here. I am not sure you can apply for a family visa right away. You need to meet certain requirements before your family can join you which indirectl means you have to be here first, to meet all requirements before you can apply for them. Thisis the reason why most poeple bring their family on a tourist or visitor visa as they have to be here to process there RP. On another note the process for attestation of documents is very difficult. You wilhave to attest your certificates first with teh Ministry of Foreign Affiars in Ottawa, and then by MOFA at the Qatar embassy in Ottawa before you come. Once you get here, the same process will need to be done first at the Canadian embasssy (which I am told at the embassy now that they d not do) and then at MOFA here as well before you can get your RP or sponsor your family. I am going through that right now as it is a mess. You will nee to do the same for your marriage certificate. My advise is get a proper handle on what documents need to be attested and make sure you go through all the process on teh Camnadian side before you get here. It is very messy and and very frustrating to have to arrange for document attestion remotely.

We always gave much attention to the service and the demand for visas has grown in the past years, so we had to adopt a solution,\u201d said Guido De Sanctis, Italian Ambassador to Qatar. \u201cWe had been reaching 7,000 a year a couple of years ago, then it decreased someway because of an agreement between Italy and Qatar under which certain categories of passports are exempted from visas,\u201d he added. In 2015, 5,000 visas were issued to Italy from Doha, the majority of them were tourist visas. Among them 80 percent of applicants were residents and 20 percent Qataris. The new centre will also process applications for travel to Sweden, Malta and Estonia, represented in Qatar by the Italian embassy with reference to Schengen visa applications. Applicants will be able to book appointments via www.it.ckgs.qa, web chat as well as email (italyvisa.qatar@ckgs.com). CKGS will also accept walk-in customers without appointment although the waiting time for them could be extended. CKGS will provide appointments for visa submission within three working days from the date of a request received.

IELTS, accepted by over 6,000 organizations, is the most popular system and includes universities, immigration departments, corporates and many more. Living in Qatar, IELTS is the starting point for any migration plans you might have, or even for higher studies. The British Council conducts the IELTS in Qatar and there are two versions of it - IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training. You will need to determine which test is right for you before taking it. IELTS Academic is for test takers wishing to study at undergraduate or postgraduate levels, and for those seeking professional registration. IELTS General Training IELTS General Training is for test takers wishing to migrate to an English-speaking country (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK), and for those wishing to train or study at below degree level. IELTS is designed to assess English language skills across a wide range of levels. There is no such thing as a pass or fail in IELTS. Results are reported as band scores on a scale from 1 (the lowest) to 9 (the highest). There are four components of the test: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. IELTS tests are conducted thrice a month in Qatar at Al Ahnaf Bin Qais Independent School, Al Dafna Area, West Bay. Your Listening, Reading and Writing test will be completed on the same day. Your Speaking test will take place on the same day, or up to a week before or after your main test day. Make sure you check the test timing well in advance, because you lose your fee amount if you arrive late. To register you can visit this link: https://ielts.britishcouncil.org/qatar?_ga=1.227251861.989396814.1477319314 On completing registration, you will receive an email containing access details to the British Council\u2019s online resources for free.

Drivers are always looking for WHEN & WHERE there will be more riders. The pricing should have been QR 1 per minute once the wheels start rolling - straight and simple. As for their drivers not many of them realise that Uber robs them similarly. On the website they announce that they get only 20% of the ride, meaning if the ride is QR 100 then Uber gets only QR 20. But once or twice every day UBER takes away anything upto 40 to 50% of the bigger pie (mostly cash transaction) depending upon the strange algorithm writing into the software. The drivers do not have an option in their system to even contest the 40% loot. If drivers protest its easy to kick them out of the system. Moreover more Kms the car runs the more they spend for fuel/maintenance/outside food. These 3 are unavoidable expense for a driver. Most drivers do not account properly for it and think erroneously that Uber is great money making machine. If a car runs around 300kms per day it gets severely degraded and maintenance cost soars at least by 2.5 times. Just imagine there must be around 100,000 drivers in Qatar and using them, UBER makes atleast QR1million DAILY without as much putting a single desk/phone/office or even chair in Qatar and not even giving QR1 for Qatar Government. Is this how business is done? How can the Govt allow this daylight ROBBERY of both the rider & driver HAPPEN in Qatar? The government has to block Uber website just like it blocks porn until Uber makes its pricing straight, simple, clear and without \"surge\". The drivers have committed their QR70,000 to 90,000 new vehicle, the riders have committed their credit cards and what has Uber's committed? Is this how ANY business is done? As for their correspondence work, most probably UBER has outsourced their work to some small office in India's call centre hub running 24x7. Drivers reach riders because of the marvel of Google MAPS & GPS navigation both of which Uber uses for free. Zero credit for Uber for that. Uber should not get more than 1QR from every ride irrespective of its length."}

The series, which premiered at the Education City\u2019s Ceremonial Court, is designed to take children aged 2 to 8 on an educational journey of discovery, while instilling a love of the Arabic language from an early age. The animated series follows the life of Rashid and his older sister Noura, along with a group of friends. Their adventures, set and inspired by Qatari landmarks, aims to entertain and educate, while stimulating creativity and innovation through imagination.\u00a0 Each episode is dedicated to a specific letter of the Arabic alphabet, and centres around helping children learn the Arabic language (Fus\u2019ha). \u201cPreserving the Arabic language requires us to work together, encouraging our children to learn our language and uphold our culture,\u201d said Sheikha Hind.

Hamad, Co-Founder and CEO of the establishment, works perfectly in tandem with Maryam, who is the company\u2019s Co-Founder and Chef. They specialise in authentic homemade desserts, bringing local and western dessert recipes together and presenting them with an original and unique touch. All their products are hand mixed and created to ensure authentic taste. sat down with them for a quick chat. Here are excerpts of the interview. \u00a0 : We were fortunate to live in an extended family. We experienced first hand the warmth of our grandmothers and their generosity towards guests during weekly social gatherings. Desserts were always among the offerings. While our mother made some of it, their friends brought the rest. Our mom transferred her passion of dessert making to Maryam. Soon, I started noticing how after eating our desserts, family and friends would tell us how scrumptious they were. I also remembered the many times my mom and Maryam would make special desserts at their relatives\u2019 and friends\u2019 requests. Driven by our belief that the best way to enjoy life is to do something you are passionate about, Jaddah and Granny was born in 2014. \u00a0 We started operating from our home for the first two years and now, we are moving to our own villa. We own a virtual store on the internet \u2014  \u00a0 We\u2019ve always thrived on challenges. We had a lot of fun coming up with a viable business idea and model, developing a long-term vision, assembling a business team and leveraging on our team\u2019s strengths, promoting and executing our marketing plan and understanding our customers\u2019 true needs. \u00a0 We wish to see government appreciate home businesses by giving them ratings and accreditation based on objective criteria. \u00a0 The most exciting part is surely sharing our authentic recipes with customers and seeing how they have enjoyed it. The everyday joy of baking, seeing returning customers, getting repeat orders, seeing the entire family work together as a single unit\u2026 that\u2019s the joy of this business. \u00a0 After several trials and errors and exploring many ideas, the name Jaddah and Granny stuck. Our desserts are inspired by both Qatari and Western cuisines, run by women since olden times. The name of the business symbolises women who gave us this unique heritage. At the moment, it is difficult for people to identify the value proposition of our brand with just our name. But with creativity and some help from branding experts, we will try hard to make it easier to communicate the essence of our brand. \u00a0 We are making the most of social media presence. We are active on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. From experience, I feel the best channels to market our products are Instagram and Facebook. We also started selling our products in the local community via exhibitions. We received invitations from local entities supporting small businesses in Qatar such as Social Development Center (SDC), Bedaya Center and Qatar Development Bank. \u00a0 \u00a0 Most of our recipes come to us late at night. When things get quiet, Maryam listens to melodies and starts experimenting by herself in the kitchen. We usually try our recipes with family and friends before sharing it with the community. Baking is both an art and a science. New recipes require elaborate efforts, experimentations and failures. Each chef has her/his own essence. \u00a0 At the moment, we are selling our goods to those who appreciate the joys of a delicious dessert, without overriding their calorie intake. We are aware of the diet trend and are working hard to enhance some of our existing recipes to be healthy options as well. \u00a0 We sell a dozen goodie jars for QR250. We justify the prices with the authenticity of our recipes and high quality of our sourced ingredients that are reflected in the remarkable taste. As we are selling to niche customers, we seldom get complains about pricing. Here is a little story. One day, one of our returning customers commented about our higher-range prices. We spoke to her about the reasoning behind the pricing and she agreed with us. She went on to try several other options in the market, but kept returning to us. She said she was convinced of the quality, authentic taste and branding of Jaddah and Granny. \u00a0 To order Jaddah and Granny\u2019s mouth-watering desserts, visit   or call 66665974 for WhatsApp orders.

Will start with Zekreet this weekend", "commentId": "comment-7420246"}], "question": "For those of you who thought Qatar has no ancient architectural ruins and forts except Zubarah, here is a list of forts and ancient settlements that you can check out, if you haven\u2019t already. The below list is testament to Qatar\u2019s rich history. How many of these have you visited? The walled coastal town of Al Zubarah was a thriving pearl fishing and trading port in the late 18th\u00a0century and early 19th\u00a0centuries, before it was destroyed in 1811 and abandoned in the early 1900s. Founded by merchants from Kuwait, Al Zubarah had trading links across the Indian Ocean, Arabia and Western Asia. A layer of sand blown from the desert has protected the remains of the site\u2019s palaces, mosques, streets, courtyard houses, and fishermen\u2019s huts; its harbour and double defensive walls, a canal, walls, and cemeteries. Excavation has only taken place over a small part of the site, which offers an outstanding testimony to an urban trading and pearl-diving tradition which sustained the region\u2019s major coastal towns and led to the development of small independent states that flourished outside the control of the Ottoman, European, and Persian empires eventually building up to the modern day Gulf States. The fort of\u00a0Al Rakayat, north west of Doha, is one of several desert forts dating back to the 19th century, and one of the few that were renovated during the 1980s. A freshwater well sits in the fort and the scattered remains of a village can be found nearby. Al Rakayat is the Arabic word for \u2018well\u2019 and it\u2019s believed that the fort was built to protect the essential sources of water in the area. It is typical of desert forts, with three rectangular towers and one cylindrical one. Three sides of the central courtyard are aligned with narrow rooms, without windows and doors that open onto the light and spacious courtyard. Freiha, also called\u00a0Furayhah, is a small deserted settlement on the northwestern coast of Qatar\u00a0in the Madinat ash Shamal municipality. It is located in the\u00a0 \u00a0region, roughly 3\u00a0km north of\u00a0 \u00a0town. It was founded by the\u00a0Al Bin Ali\u00a0tribe , main and principal\u00a0 \u00a0tribe in the first half of the eighteenth century along with the historical town of\u00a0 In the centre of the site is the fort, a 45 meter square building with high defensive walls and corner towers. On the shoreline nearby are the remains of a traditional Qatari mosque. Fishing was clearly important for the inhabitants of Freiha \u2013 fish bones were recovered from the town and stone fish traps still survive in the sea. Ruwayda is a lesser-known ancient town in northern Qatar. It was abandoned towards the end of the 18th century, however, it is now one of the largest archaeological sites in northern Qatar, stretching for more than 2.5km along the beach of a shallow bay. Recent excavations have revealed a large fortress, palatial residence, two wells, warehouses, a mosque, a ship repair shop, a walled tomb, and the remains of other temporary structures. Findings from the sea nearby tell a story of far-reaching trade contacts, with porcelain cups from China, Japan and Myanmar, earthenware from Julfar and Bahrain, and stone paste fritware from Iran. Ceramics from Europe have been found, mangrove beams, thought to have roofed the rooms, imported from Africa, red granite mortars probably from Iran, and a piece of bone carved in the form of an Oryx. Al Thaqab Fort is located in the north of Qatar and presents itself as a good example of simplistic military architecture from olden times. Al Thaqab is very close to Ruwayda fort, so if you have located Ruwayda, you might as well drive by to check Al Thaqab too.\u00a0 Zekreet Fort is located in the massive area of Zekreet, which most of you might have visited. The fort dates back to the late 18th or early 19th century. The fort's shape is quadrangular with four circular watchtowers. At the initial time of construction, the fort did not have any towers. The towers were instead added to each side in a reconstruction phase. Facilities for \" \" (date syrup) production are believed to have been at the site. If you\u2019re driving to Zekreet, might as well make a day of it as there is a beach nearby as well! Al Huwaila is possibly one of the oldest towns in Qatar, and was quite prominent long before Al Zubara and Doha were developed. The fort is located 29km north of Al Khor and was built during the early Islamic period. It is known to have been occupied by Al Musallam members of the Bani Khalid family in the 18th century. Al Koot Fort, most commonly known as the\u00a0Doha Fort, is a historical\u00a0 \u00a0located in the heart of\u00a0 ,\u00a0 's capital city. It was built in 1927 by Sheikh\u00a0  ruled Qatar from 1913 until 1949. The fort was later converted into a\u00a0 . Qatari traditional\u00a0 , products and photos of daily life with illustrations are housed in the fort. Exhibits and artworks include handicrafts,\u00a0 \u00a0and wooden ornaments, fishing equipment and boats, historical photos and paintings including oil paintings of craft workers and daily life. Barzan Towers\u00a0also known as the\u00a0Umm Salal Mohammed Fort Towers, are\u00a0 \u00a0that were built in the late 19th century and renovated in 1910 by Sheikh\u00a0 . They are located at the southern side of the defensive system established at the end of the 19th century and start of the 20th century to protect the 'rawdat', a valley where precious\u00a0 \u00a0is collected when it flows down from higher ground. The buildings were restored in 2003. The towers measure 16 metres high. The fort links to two other fortified buildings towards the west and another tower towards the north. Barzan Towers may have been built near the sea to keep an observant eye on pearl divers, as a look-out for approaching ships, and as an observatory for keeping track of the moon. Originally built with coral rock and limestone cementing the structures featured traditional Qatari design and building methods including \" \" wooden to drain rainwater during storms away from the building walls, a \" \" room between the towers to receive guests, and four-layer roofs with \"danchal\" wood pole construction, 'basgijl,' woven bamboo strips, mangrove mesh and a layer of compressed mud. The Barzan Towers have been rebuilt with features such as air-conditioners. Al Wajbah Fort\u00a0is one of the oldest forts in\u00a0 . Located in the locality of\u00a0 \u00a0in\u00a0 , the fort was built in 1882 and was the location of an important battle when the army of Sheikh\u00a0 \u00a0defeated the\u00a0 \u00a0in 1893.\u00a0It was used as the residence of\u00a0 \u00a0at various periods. The fort's most prominent features are its four watchtowers. It underwent restoration in the later 20th century."}

Two police officers in Samawa confirmed the kidnappings and said security forces launched a wide-scale search for the Qataris. \"An armed group driving dozens of pickup trucks kidnapped at least 26 Qatari hunters from their camp in the area of Busaya in Samawa desert near Saudi borders,\" Samawa governor Falih al-Zayady said. Hunters from various Gulf states often travel to the area at this time of year for hunting. A Samawa police colonel said the hunters were escorted by an Iraqi security force but that it decided not to engage a large number of gunmen. \"We are talking about at least 100 gunmen armed with light and medium weapons broke into the Qatari camp and abducted the hunters at around 3 am local time on Wednesday,\" said the police colonel. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the mass abduction. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant militants often travel in large numbers in convoys. Another police officer said initial information suggested that the kidnappers managed to flee with the abducted hunters into a desert area near the southern province of Nassiriya, 185 miles south of Baghdad.

Hope I can ride one in the near future :D", "commentId": "comment-7142816"}], "question": "Camels have always been known as the ship of the desert. But in Qatar and most of its neigbouring GCC countries, it is also fondly called the \u2018Ferraris of the mud track.\u2019 They have traditionally been used for transportation. But the long-legged animals have almost completely been sidelined with the passage of time and improvements in transportation. However camel racing, as a sport, has stood the test of time. And a few lucky animals still get to live life in the lap of luxury, eating well and training regularly for sprints around a 4km racetrack. Qatar has a long tradition in camel racing. While the sport has been practiced for hundreds of years, it was officially recognised as a professional sport in 1973. Since rearing camels and training them are very expensive, the sport is also known as \u2018the sport of Sheikhs.\u2019 A good camel, with strong bloodline, can cost up to QR1m. Camel owners acquire large plots of land to keep the animal trained and also spend a fortune on its feed. But all these expenses can be covered once the animal starts winning races. Qatar\u2019s camel racing season usually begins in October and lasts until March. The season\u2019s most prestigious competition is the \u2018Emir\u2019s Sword Race,\u2019 which concluded on March 11. Races are usually organised at Al Shahaniya track for the strong and resilient Qatar camels and the light and speedy Sudanese breed. In 2005, Qatar banned the practice of using child jockeys to steer camels during races. Nowadays, robot jockeys control the animal via electronic whips and verbal prompts from a built-in speaker. If you have not seen a camel race before, definitely go for one. It will be an experience of a lifetime. Qatar\u2019s Camel racing Committee website (Arabic) has more details about races: http://www.hejen.qa/ If you are not a native Arabic speaker, then Google Translate will be your best friend."}

{"subject": "Fire up your artistic passion in Qatar", "username": "Haashmie Doha", "topic": "qatari-culture", "question": "Some of the best kept secrets of Qatar are its multifaceted artistic scenes. Such a healthy combination of science and art is remarkable in Qatar. This facet is apparent upon arrival to Hamad International Airport, where beholders are in awe of the huge teddy bear that sits on a podium at the center of the airport's Retail Gallery. The art scene in Qatar kicked off more in mid to late 1900\u2019s. It dates back to rock carvings in Jebel Jassassiyeh, Jabel Fuwairet, Simaisma, Al Wakra which were discovered in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s. In respect of preserving this heritage, Qatar has dedicated specific sections in museums displaying these artifacts. The Museum of Islamic Art houses a huge amount of calligraphy, scripture pages, vessels, scrolls, coins, ornaments, paintings and artifacts from the Islamic and cultural history that depict the life of yore in Qatar and the Arabian lands. Since weaving and dyeing fabrics was an essential part of Qatari tradition, it carried on in modern forms of art on fabric. The original methods were quite tedious and each step was performed manually. It was a laborious and time consuming process. Most of the old architecture has given way to modern buildings; however, the Qatar Museums Authority has taken steps to preserve the architectural heritage. The ancient architecture is manifest in the forms of various forts and ruins in and around Qatar. The modern cityscape is a sight to behold, giving us a glimpse of a futuristic city. Various installations of art can be found at unexpected places in Qatar. The aim of these installations is to inspire awe in the beholder when they \u2018stumble\u2019 upon them. Don\u2019t be surprised when you see huge sculpture at Katara made of steel and brass utensils representing the head of a soldier. It is a part of  by artist Subodh Gupta. The tallest art installation in Qatar is the  , by American artist Richard Serra, near Zekreet. Universities in Qatar offer art education in a wide variety of media. The artistic scene is not limited to painting and architecture, but extends to the harmonious blend of music, dance, poetry and writing. The range of artistic endeavors is diverse. Art workshops from oil painting to acrylics, mix media and silk painting, to entertainment art forms like philharmonic orchestra, music and dance lessons are offered throughout Qatar. With so much art influence around you, you cannot miss harnessing your artistic passion. Check out the  happening all over Qatar, and you are bound to find the perfect match to kindle or rekindle your penchant for art. Art workshops are always going on at Katara Cultural Village, Souq Waqif, Museum of Islamic Art, Virginia Commonwealth University and various art centers in Qatar. Keep checking the  section to stay updated and enroll in the course of your liking. Find activity clubs of your choice and join them. Many clubs are established catering to artists, bringing them together on a single platform and sharing best tips and techniques and places to buy art merchandise. These clubs range from artists, photographers, painters, to writers in Qatar. Sessions dedicated to prose and poetry are held at Katara regularly under the label of \u2018Words and Strings\u2019. Other clubs worthy of mention are Qatar Women\u2019s Professional Network (QPWN Book Club), Silk painting in Qatar, Doha Writer\u2019s Workshop, to name a few. Universities have regular community courses for people who want to learn a new skill but don\u2019t have the time to enroll in a full length course. IAID and Virginia Commonwealth University Qatar have a wide variety of community programs every season. Bring out your brushes and canvasses and paint the town red, or whatever color you fancy!"}

Saeed Al Sulaiti (Pedercini Racing) took the opportunity to guide his racing counterparts Tom Sykes (Kawasaki Racing Team), Jordi Torres (Althea BMW Racing Team), Xavi Fores (Barni Racing Team), Leon Camier (MV Agusta Reparto Corse) and Michael van der Mark (Honda World Superbike Team) through the snaking labyrinth of the incredible Souq Waqif in Doha. First stop was the Falcon Centre where the riders admired the regal hunting birds perched on display. Al Sulaiti explained that the wild falcons were trained to hunt from a young age and that all the birds on display had already been sold except for the one they were holding. Torres was the first to jump at the opportunity to hold the falcon, petting the wild creature in front of the media and onlookers. A nervous looking Fores was next to hold the wild hunter and was relieved when Camier asked to take it next. The Brit took the opportunity to get a selfie with the falcon before all the riders gathered together to get a photo with the amazing bird. They then strolled through the winding narrow pathways of the traditional Souq, taking in the sweet scents of spice and perfumes filling the air. Al Sulaiti directed the riders to a traditional coffee shop where they settled for a quick pit stop. They drank Arabic coffee with dried dates and the customary Tahania dip. Once refreshed and refuelled, they continued on their Middle Eastern journey through Qatari culture. The final stop was a small shop hidden in the shadows of the bazaar selling traditional men's headwear. Al Sulaiti explained the different components of the headdress and then showed everyone how to put it on. Once the riders were fitted for their own, they took AlSulaiti's lead and attempted it for themselves. They emerged into the middle of the Souq for one last photo opportunity together, all wearing the traditional Gahfia and Ghitras. Then it was back to the circuit for final preparations ahead of Free Practice on Friday the 28th October to kick off the final weekend of WorldSBK for 2016."}

The idea is to preserve the purity of the Arabic language amid the use of many foreign languages that are spoken by different expatriate communities in Qatar. The proposed law also seeks to make sure that the status of Arabic as Qatar's national language is not diluted or eroded by foreign languages. The draft law has been prepared by the Doha-based International Organisation for the Advancement of Arabic Language. The Organisation is part of Qatar Foundation and was set up in 2013 as a non-profit body. The draft law was discussed in a recent meeting of the trustees of the organisation. One of the aims of the organisation is to fight the use of so-called dialects of Arabic in which corrupted forms of Arabic words and foreign words and sentences are used. The draft law would discourage mixing of Arabic with any other language and its use in public \u2014 in educational institutions, business establishments and offices, service institutions and the media. Shops and business establishments would need to pay special attention since signboards and letterheads used by them would have to use impeccable Arabic. The organisation feels that the Arabic spoken by many in Qatar is not proper, so there is a need to take corrective measures, and hence the draft law. The prestige of the Arabic language is to be maintained at any cost so that people feel proud of it, and the draft legislation aims at that. The draft law would also encourage translation of Arabic works into other languages and vice versa. Additionally, it would encourage research to develop Arabic technical and scientific terms and the language's use in modern technology and eventually set up an Arabic Academy. Meanwhile, an expert told this newspaper that once the draft law sees the light of day, Asians speaking their version of Arabic would need to be careful. They wouldn't be able to, for example, say: \"Mafi Maloom (for \"I don't know\"). That's improper Arabic. The proper Arabic for \"I don't know\" is \"La Alam\". Similarly, some Asians say \"Inta rafiq maal ana\" (\"You are my friend\"). This is improper Arabic. The correct Arabic is: \"Anta Rafiqui\". The language expert said that because of their large and long-time presence here, Asian expatriates had introduced terms such as 'seedha' (for 'alatool' or straight), 'dravel' (for 'saiq' or driver) and 'Baba' for sponsor. \"These are just a few examples. There are many such foreign words and corrupted sentences used in spoken Arabic in Qatar,\" said the expert. It is time that ends, and the use of proper Arabic language and words is encouraged, he said, adding that he welcomed the draft law since the Arabic language is being wrongly influenced by the other languages.

Being a Muslim country, Qatar is generally more conservative than most western countries. It pays to be aware of its culture and the etiquettes you need to observe. This way, you get on the good side of the people here and avoid offending anyone. Although Qatar is a Muslim country, many of its residents are expats, so you can say that they are somewhat accepting of how Westerners live. Nevertheless, you should be sensitive to their customs and beliefs and be careful not to rub people the wrong way just because you didn't do your research. Since you will be staying here for a while, it's important to be mindful of your manners. Here are some basic tidbits to help you stay out of trouble and get along well with the locals of Qatar. You can expect Qatar to be quite conservative as it is a Muslim country. However, it is not as strict as in other countries like Saudi Arabia. If you are a woman, you are not expected to wear an abaya, which is a long black over garment that goes down to the ankles. But make sure that your shoulders, upper arms and knees are all covered up when you go out. You will also feel safer as you do not solicit negative attention when you're in public places. For men, it is acceptable to wear pants and shirt. You can wear anything you want when you are in the privacy of your hotel or apartment. If you are going for a swim, it is fine to wear Western-style swimwear in hotels or private club swimming pools. It is not customary for men to shake hands with women, although it can happen during business dealings. There are many foreign companies in Qatar, so the locals get to adopt the Western salutation of shaking hands. To be safe, shake the hand of a woman only if she extends her hand first. There will be cases where Arab men and women will not be comfortable with handshake as a form of greeting. You may see some put a hand on their chest. This should signal to you that they prefer this form of greeting over shaking hands. Ramadan is an important part of the Islamic religious belief, so you should be sensitive if your visit or stay coincides with Ramadan observance. During this time, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset. You should be sensitive enough not to eat or drink in public. This can appear as offensive to people who are fasting. Nothing should stop you, however, if you are in the privacy of your home. Some hotels also cater to foreigners who wish to eat during the day. You could get jailed or pay a fine if you do not know the laws of the land. Be careful not bring alcohol, pork, pornographic materials and drugs with you at the airport. Your luggage will be searched, so be mindful of what you cannot bring into the country. Alcohol is not regarded as illegal in Qatar, but there are strong restrictions. For instance, do not make the mistake of offering alcohol to a Muslim or a minor. As a non-Muslim, you can buy and consume liquor in hotels and restaurants that are licensed to sell them. They are served in restricted and licensed areas only. If you are an expat, you can apply for a liquor license that will allow you to purchase alcohol from a licensed store. Once purchased, make sure to take it home right away and keep it hidden from public view. If you want to stay out of trouble, be mindful of topics you discuss. Sure, the locals may start to passionately discuss religion and politics, and you may be tempted to air your opinion. It's just an opinion, you may think and a person's opinion is supposed to be respected even if you don't agree with it. But it will be better not to get involved in heated discussions, especially those involving religion and politics. The rule is to be sensitive about people's beliefs, customs and tradition. Even better, appreciate and respect their passion and faith. This is a rule that applies to everyone in general, even outside Islamic countries. You could lose friends, seriously offend and even break hearts if you are not careful about having your mind heard and considered. It will be best to talk about the other person's family or children. Stay safe with general discussion topics that will foster good working relationship and friendship. Along the way, you will learn more detailed social taboos such as showing the sole of your foot, which is considered rude. It's also good to note that passing food with your left hand is seen as unclean, so keep that in mind when dining with a group. As you begin to experience and learn more about the customs and culture of Qatar, you will soon appreciate the beauty of their way of living. :\u00a0"}

Be prepared to be spoilt by the organisers of QIFF 2015 as they host a free culinary workshop for chefs. The 2-hour course will be taught by renowned Gulf region Chefs Aisha Al Tamimi and Fawaz Al Omaim, who will be sharing their culinary expertise to their fellow chefs at Qatar Airways\u2019 Live Cooking Theatre during QIFF 2015. Chef Aisha is considered to be the \u2018Queen of Qatari cuisine\u2019 and has published many cookbooks focusing on the culinary traditions of Gulf cuisine. \u00a0She has also found the time to host TV and radio programs and has had her articles published in Qatari newspapers. Her fellow co-teacher Chef Fawaz is another regional legend whose passion for cooking began whilst he was a student in Miami. He categorises himself unabashedly as a self-taught chef and enjoys trying new flavours and tastes, which has resulted in his own recipe invention within the Arab food heritage. \u00a0 \u00a0 Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA) has worked hard to provide this innovative course for all hotel chefs within Qatar. It is hoped that the sharing of the region\u2019s culinary heritage will encourage the attendees to utilise Qatari and Khaleeji cooking into their own dishes. It will also help to spread the word and knowledge about the region\u2019s food legacy, and provide an international outlet for the traditions of Qatari cuisine. \u00a0 The course will run throughout QIFF 2015 (from 24th-28th March) at MIA Park at 2-4pm every day. \u00a0Hotels will be contacted by QTA and they will be able to send one chef as its representative, as well as any of its chefs on any other day of the festival. Doha has a large population of chefs trained in international cuisine, and it is hoped that this course will help chefs become familiar and comfortable with Qatar\u2019s rich food traditions. It is all part of a concerted effort by QTA to arrange events that will encourage hotels to highlight regional cuisine. QTA will later build upon this momentum by working with local hotels to include Qatari dishes, such as Machbous or Thereed, on their menus thus introducing the cuisine to international visitors. \u00a0 \u00a0 Make sure you contact your hotel management if you are interested in learning how to cook Qatari dishes. Chefs will be expected to wear their hotel-branded chef uniforms during the course. For more information contact  . For those non-professional chefs amongst us don\u2019t worry there will also be live cooking demonstrations on all days of the QIFF, with free samples at the end! More detailed information about QIFF 2015 can be found at  . \u00a0"}

Others argue that nationality should not be taken into consideration for marriage.\u00a0 Many reasons are cited for Qatari men marrying foreigners. These include the \u201crestrictive\u201d traditional way of choosing a bride, the expenditure involved in giving \u2018mehar,\u2019 and the difficulty of finding a bride. Others say Qatari men marry a foreigner as their second wife because Qatari women don\u2019t like to be in that position. The issue has been widely debated in the social media and other platforms by citizens. The debate is going on against the backdrop of the fact that Qatari women, who once used to get married in their teens, are now putting off marriage to their late 20s or early 30s to focus on education or pursue a career, as a study has found. Only one percent of Qatari women now marry between 15 and 19 years of age. At the same time, figures from the Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics say that 66 of the 106 husbands who got divorced in January 2014 were Qataris. The number of Qatari wives who got divorced that month was 56, as against 50 non-Qatari wives. A total of 341 marriages were registered in January. Children of Qatari men married to foreign women get Qatari citizenship and the benefits that come with it, but children of Qatari women married to foreigners do not. Qatari columnist Faizal Al Marzouqi wrote in a recent article that he was shocked when one of his friends decided to marry a lady from a South Asian country. \u201cI didn\u2019t discuss the reasons behind the marriage or insist that he marry a Qatari, but what came to my mind was the future of the children,\u201d wrote Al Marzouqi.\u00a0 He argues that Qatari society is not yet ready to accept children of foreign mothers, whose appearance would be different from that of most Qataris.\u00a0 \u201cTaking into consideration the fact that our society is not yet mixed like others, we still think about skin colour, hair.\u2026 It will affect the children\u2019s psychology and they will feel that they are discriminated against and will hate society,\u201d says Al Marzouqi.\u00a0 He has urged Qatari men to marry Qatari women, saying: \u201cYour fellow Qatari girls are the best and most beautiful and suitable for you. And don\u2019t let your children hate you when they differ from the society they live in.\u201d Several others have expressed their opinions on Twitter and Qatari social media in favour of or against Qatari men marrying foreigners. Some have also said that children of Qatari women married to foreigners should be given citizenship.\u00a0 \u201cThere are many reasons behind Qatari men marrying foreigners, including the high expenses on \u2018mehar\u2019, living standards, accommodation and marriage requirements, and the marriage becomes a kind of competition. \u00a0But when it comes to marriage with a non-Qatari, the expenses are less,\u201d said a commentator on a popular Qatari social media.\u00a0 Another said, \u201cWhen a man thinks of marrying a Qatari girl, the first thing that comes to his mind is money, to get a loan and spend long years repaying it.\u201d Also, some claim that Qatari men marry foreigners only as their second wives.\u00a0 \u201cMany people (Qatari) marry a foreigner as their second wife. Anyhow, marrying a foreigner has positive and negative aspects. But Islam never mentions tribe or nationality regarding marriage,\u201d said a commentator.\u00a0 \u201cSome men want to marry a second time, but Qatari women don\u2019t like to be the second wife,\u201d said another commentator.\u00a0 Yet another said, \u201cMarrying a foreigner is better than having an illegitimate relationship.\u201d\u00a0 Some claim that the traditional method of finding a bride in Qatari society is among the reasons for men preferring a foreign bride.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s better to get married to a Qatari woman. But sometimes there are too many restrictions. It\u2019s easy to see foreigners, talk to them and get to know them. It\u2019s easier than with a Qatari girl. In this case, the husband and wife come to know each other. Lack of understanding before marriage is one of the negative aspects leading to divorce,\u201d said a commentator.\u00a0 Some say the reasons behind Qatari men marrying foreigners should be considered seriously. \u00a0 \u201cPeople should really understand the reasons behind Qataris marrying foreigners,\u201d urged a commentator. Some are of the opinion that children of Qatari women who marry foreigners should be given citizenship rights.\u00a0 \u201cI hope the doors open for Qatari women to marry GCC nationals or others. Their children should be given citizenship and all privileges,\u201d said a commentator.\u00a0 However, many strongly reject this and argue that Qatari men marrying foreigners can have negative consequences for society. \u00a0 \u201cSome children are being insulted due to the origin of their father or mother,\u201d said a commentator on Twitter.\u00a0 \u201cNot all families ask for too much money, and because of money if they marry foreigners, who will marry Qatari girls?\u201d asked a commentator on social media.\u00a0 \u201cLook at our homes: there are many who have passed the age of marriage,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cThe minimum cost of a simple marriage in Qatar is QR400,000. This is my experience with my brother\u2019s marriage, so why should someone take a loan for a marriage,\u201d read another comment.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWho said it\u2019s less expensive to marry foreigner? One will have to spend his whole life for the foreigner and her family for travelling and others expenses,\u201d argued a commentator.\u00a0 \u201cPeople have the right to take a decision on their lives but it shouldn\u2019t affect their children in future,\u201d said another comment. \u00a0 Law number 21 of 1989 regulates the marriage of Qataris to foreigners. According to the law, a committee, now led by Abdul Al Maal as chairman and with members from different government institutes and ministries, including the Ministry of Awqaf, \u00a0 receives applications for such marriages. It examines them and gives its recommendation to the Ministry of Interior. The final decision is taken by the Minister of Interior.\u00a0 \u201cThe problem of Qataris marrying foreigners became an issue after people started travelling to foreign countries. Then a law was introduced to address the problem in 1989,\u201d said a senior Qatari lawyer, Muhsin Ziab Al Suwaidi.\u00a0 \u201cThis law doesn\u2019t prevent anyone from marrying a foreigner, but it regulates and helps to maintain the Qatari family fabric as a core of the Qatari society,\u201d he added.\u00a0 The Qatar government has asked all Arab and Muslim countries not to give their citizens to Qataris in marriage without government approval. \u00a0\u00a0 Children of Qatari men who marry a foreigner without permission from the government do not get Qatari citizenship. Also, in such cases the foreign wife will not get a residence permit in Qatar.\u00a0 Some issues are taken into consideration when the ministry grants permission for a Qatari man to marry a foreigner, said Al Suwaidi. \u00a0 He said the bridegroom should be above a certain age, shouldn\u2019t have more than one wife, and shouldn\u2019t be involved in any crime or immoral activity. However, the law makes an exception for those wanting to marry someone from another GCC country. \u00a0 Applications of people with special needs are usually accepted as finding a life partner is difficult for them. Also, Qatari men are granted permission to marry relatives in other countries, according to Al Suwaidi. \u00a0\u00a0 But getting government approval to marry a foreigner is not easy for others.\u00a0 \u201cQatari law restricts marrying foreigners by making it mandatory to get approval from a special committee and have it signed by the Ministry of Interior. It may take years to complete this procedure and one of my friends waited for four years,\u201d said a commentator on social media. \u00a0 \u00a0| Photo by Jace Anonuevo from QL Flickr Group"}

The situation of families struggling to repay loans splurged on unproductive things like luxury foreign trips seems to have become so alarming that imams have begun talking against people's indebtedness in their Friday sermons. A cleric last Friday said some families spent about QR1m ($275,000) on a foreign trip and they, thus, get caught in vicious and never-ending debt traps. \"This is socially dangerous,\" warned Sheikh Abdullah Al Sada in his last sermon. He said rising indebtedness in the community is largely due to bank loans taken to fund leisure trips. \"Some 80 percent of problem and un-serviced loans are these loans,\" he said in remarks published by local Arabic daily Al Raya yesterday. And Al Watan quoted a businessman as saying that it would be wiser if people saved from their earnings regularly and spent it on foreign holidays or to buy new cars. Mohamed Abdullah Al Obaidly said people should try to save at least 10-20 percent of monthly earnings and these savings could be spent on overseas trips or new vehicles. \"This would mean they would not have to take loans.\" Hind Al Muftah told the daily that people usually believed that taking loans and getting into debt traps was their problem. \"This is not true. Indebtedness concerns entire society. It is a social evil.\" She said it was unfortunate that the community was fast becoming addicted to consumerism as people tended to splurge money on unproductive things. \"What should be encouraged is productivity, not a consumerist culture in our society.\" Dr Rajab A Ismail, a Qatar University professor, blamed banks for making promotions for tour loan packages during the summer and said they should raise awareness against the social dangers of indebtedness. He said people could save money by going on overseas trips in groups and as part of packages. [ ]"}

But that option is out now since one needs about QR180,000 to hold marriage parties in tents, he added. In some GCC countries, people have begun holding simple marriage parties early in the evening and serve only tea, coffee and refreshments to guests to cut costs, he said. \u201cWe should emulate such examples and economise,\u201d said Al Marri. \u201cExorbitant marriage costs are to blame for many young men and women remaining unmarried until late.\u201d Yet another Qatari, Nasser Al Abdullah, said the government is building many wedding halls across the country and they could be used by nationals at nominal rent. \u201cThe government should hasten up and build the halls as soon as possible,\u201d said Al Abdullah. It is foolish to spend QR300,000 (as rent for halls) for just a few hours, said Naji Al Nuaimi, a citizen. Psychologist Dr Batool Khalifa said escalating marriage costs were responsible for late marriages in the community. People take loans from banks and are unable to repay. This causes social and psychological problems for them in the long run.    |     in the "}

{"subject": "Qatar trying to preserve historic wells", "username": "Doha Socialite", "topic": "qatari-culture", "question": "The Architectural Conservation Department within the Qatar Museums Authority is responsible for the preservation, conservation and restoration of tangible heritage in Qatar. These include historic buildings like mosques, houses, palaces, castles, forts and towers along with their decorative and artistic elements. In addition, the department is in charge of the rehabilitation of these buildings and their use for appropriate cultural and touristic events. Owing to rapid urbanisation in Qatar, wells and springs have been neglected for a long time; located underground and often in uninhabited areas, they are no longer as indispensable as they once were. Most of them have dried up and deteriorated, while some have become receptacles for waste and other residue. Wells and springs played and still play an important role as they are the main source of natural water since there are no perennial rivers in Qatar. They are useful in research as indicators for the location of past settlements that existed wherever there was a water source. In 2004, a project was launched to document and preserve them as historic landmarks: wells and springs within Qatar were inventoried and recorded. Their exact locations, construction techniques (mostly built of gravel and clay), history, local names and traditions were acquired through interviews with locals and the collection of oral information. A total of 107 wells and springs have so far been documented. The Architectural Conservation Department constantly monitors their condition and when necessary takes action for their conservation. The well of Ain Hleetan, located on the west coast of Al Khor, is an example of restoration and preservation. The well, which has a cylindrical shape and is built of gravel, clay and plaster, is connected to an external water collection basin that served as reservoir for animal drinking water. It was the main reason for the settlement of the Al Mahanda tribe in the city of Al Khor. According to a local tradition, around 150 years ago, a group of hunters found the water source accidentally thanks to a hare that they tried to catch. The source was then encircled with stones. In addition, some old oral sources describe the exceptionally salubrious features of the water from the well that reputedly cured many illnesses to the extent that local residents used to call it \u2018the Doctor\u2019. The people of Al Khor remember that the well used to be cleaned and maintained every six months, during which the well was closed to stop the water flow and, once the well was emptied, burlap was used to clean the inner walls of the well. Nowadays this water source is maintained and monitored by the Architectural Conservation Department."}

The upcoming complex on Al Rafa Road on way to Dukhan is expected to be ready next year. National Day revelry is held on Al Rafa Road every year. The halls have a capacity of 500 people each and can be temporarily linked to be used for a large wedding. The centrally air-conditioned halls will be fully furnished. The complex will boast huge parking lots, and other facilities. The upcoming complex has been designed in keeping with Qatari architecture. This is phase one of a cluster of such complexes the government has plans to build across the country. The halls are being built in keeping with Emiri directives to help and encourage Qatari youth to marry. Young Qataris had long been complaining of back-breaking wedding expenses, much of which went on renting private marriage halls or those in star hotels. This prevented a large number of limited-income young Qataris from tying the knot. And those who nonetheless married were caught in bank debt traps and would spend years repaying the loans. Financial strains sometimes led to marital discords and even divorce. Some families are so particular about the wedding venue that they tell the groom\u2019s side to hold banquets in select places. The complex housing the marriage halls will be spread over an area of 260,000 square metres. So high are marriage hall rents (about a third of the total expense) that a civil society group last year announced plans to build some eight large wedding venues to be rented out to needy Qataris on reasonable charges. The Social Development Centre (SDC) in June 2012 even said it would raise funds for the purpose from the Qatari community through an initial public offering (IPO). Qatari columnists have been raising the issue for quite some time saying that high marriage expenses were a social curse in their community.\u00a0 Public representative body, the Central Municipal Council (CMC), also took up the matter and made recommendations to the civic ministry to build such facilities for Qatari youth.

NMoQ, together with museums and departments, organised activities at AlRiwaq Doha exhibition space last night with a focus on Garangao bags. \u201cIn the middle of Ramadan, Qatari families still prepare these bags to make children feel the Garangao atmosphere,\u201d said Al Khayyat. From the 1950s until now, families prefer to make bags rather than buy them. Children carry bags around the neighbourhood, singing the Garangao song and asking for nuts and sweets, he explained. \u201cMany things have changed but the spirit of Garangao remains which is to give joy to children and this cannot be taken from them. And I believe this will be continued by \u00a0the coming generations,\u201d added Al Khayyat. In the past three years, NMoQ has shown keenness to promote the deep-rooted Qatari tradition of Garangao by organising unique activities. \u201cLast year the focus was fashion; this year it is the Garangao bag, which mothers used to make at homes in the past. This is mainly for tourists and residents to know about this tradition,\u201d he explained. At last night\u2019s activity, children designed their Garangao bags with the help of parents and the best ones won gift vouchers.\u00a0 Other museums and departments also participated in the event and held their activities.\u00a0 The 3-2-1 Qatar Olympic and Sports Museum hosted traditional Qatari games for children while Mathaf held a jewellery workshop.\u00a0 Qatar Museums\u2019 (QM) Family Programmes organised a Lunar Scope activity, the Public Art Department held a mixed media art wall workshop and the Publication Department hosted a puppet show.

Actually so common it's become quite the norm, some may even argue it as becoming part of the overall  \u00a0culture. Qatar, along with several other neighboring countries such as the UAE,\u00a0has\u00a0started this trend of owning exotic animals in\u00a0homes as pets. These animals are seen as a symbol of status and wealth due to their hefty price and rarity.\u00a0 Many of the animals owned include cheetahs, tigers, lions, jaguars, panthers, leaopards, and cougars. These owners believe that having these cats as pets makes them look cool, however this puts them at risk of being labeled as animal abusers. For isntance, in Abu Dhabi, many of these animals are bought with a license, however\u00a0many people buy animals without applying for the proper permission and hence making them illegal purchases. Not only are there\u00a0social consequences to this practice, it can cause danger to owners and neighbors,\u00a0and the environmental impact on migrating often endangered animals out of their natural habitats. In fact, a few years ago a full grown tiger escaped from his owner and was seen wandering the streets of Doha, until finally reaching Education City. This was a huge issue because students received emails warning them to stay indoors because there was a tiger on the loose. You would expect the tiger would\u00a0run away from a zoo, not someone's house, so clearly having a wild cat as a pet without the necessary precautions is not a good idea.\u00a0 More recently, in January of this year, a cheetah was  \u00a0(Yes.\u00a0Right here. On this site)\u00a0for some QR35,000 \u2013 a little less than the asking price of QR40,000. Although keeping wild animals as pets is illegal under Qatari law, some people are still out there parading their precious pets to the public. I recommend the best time to see these exotic beauties is during National Day celebrations (December 18th). So what do you think? Cool or lame?

They say it is against their culture and traditions and fear that younger elements in their community may begin aping them and get spoilt. So Qataris want the authorities concerned to stop what they say is a growing menace in their midst, but a psychologist has advised caution. She said an awareness campaign should be launched to convince motorcyclists what they are doing is offensive to the local culture and social sensitivities. Ahmed Hilal, a Qatari, said young expatriate women riding pillion with male motorcyclists and holding them tightly from behind is not desirable in Qatar. \"This is immoral, but you see them openly moving in public places. Our society is conservative. We must maintain our traditions and culture,\" he said. He told Al Sharq that it was strange watching young expatriate girls as pillion passengers and tightly holding men riding motorcycles. \"This we see daily not only in Doha but also outside, in Sealine, among other areas,\" Hilal said, adding authorities must clamp down on them. He said some women pillion riders use helmets so their faces can't be seen. Prominent Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmed Al Buanain, said, \"We are afraid this social disease may inflict our society as well. \"Our religion prevents us from doing such sinful acts,\" he said, adding the Traffic Department should intervene and stop this craze. \"Men riding motorcycles are not allowed (by our religion) to even have their wives and sisters as pillion passengers. We feel socially threatened.\" Mohamed Thiyab, another Qatari, said men riding motorcycles and carrying women passengers seated behind them and holding them tightly are from different nationalities. \"Such a practice is not acceptable to us.\" Sometimes women can be seen riding motorcycles and challenging men in competitions. \"We can't tolerate such things.\" Contacted by this newspaper, prominent psychologist, Dr Moza Al Malki, said people have no right to intercept expatriate motorcyclists this way. \"First, they are not doing what they are to offend locals or challenge Qatari social values. Doing that is normal in their countries. People should not react this way. Authorities should instead launch a campaign to make motorcyclists aware of local social sensitivities and convince them to stop the practice.\" [Photo: Rutavi Mehta]"}

THE PROPHET'S WAY\u00a0regarding the two\u00a0\u202a#\u200eEids\u202c--------------------------------- Compiled by a group of students.Revised by Shaykh : Hamad Bin Abdullah al Hamad (Hafidahullah) All the praise is due to Allah, and may the prayers and greetings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, his companions and all those who adhere to them. To proceed:\u00a0Following is the explanation of the Prophet's way regarding the two Eids.[The ruling of the Eid (prayer):]Our Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) legislated the Eid prayer and prescribed the men and women to pray it. It was narrated in the Sahihayn (Bukharee and Muslim), Umm \u2018Atiyyah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah (Peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to bring menstruating women on (Eid) al-Fitr and (Eid) al-Adha, also the unmarried young virgins and mature girls who stay often screened, to take part in the gathering of the Muslims and their Duaa', but the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place). It was the practice of our Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to pray in the Musalla (Eid prayer-place which should be an open land), as narrated in the Sahihayn by Abdullah bin \u2018Umar (May Allaah be pleased with them). And if the Eid prayer is held in a mosque, there is no harm.[The description of the Eid (prayer):] The Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to begin with the Eid prayer before the khutbah, as narrated in the Sahihayn by Abdullah bin \u2018Umar (May Allaah be pleased with them). He used to offer two rak\u2019aat (units), reciting Surah al Aa'laa (chapter 87) aloud in the first rak'ah, and Surah al-Ghashiyah (chapter 88) in the second rak'ah (both after surah al-Fatihah), as narrated by Nu'maan bin Basheer (May Allaah be pleased with them) in Sahih Muslim. It was also narrated in Sahih Muslim, by Abi Waaqid al-Laythee (May Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited Surat-Qaaf (chapter 50) in the first rak'ah and Surat-al-Qamar (chapter 54) in the second.He used to perform Takbeer (said \u201cAllaahu akbar\u201d( seven times before reciting in the first rak'ah (which includes the Takbirat al-Ihraam), and six times in the second rak'ah (including the takbeer of rising up), and he raised his hands with each takbeer, as narrated in Sunan Abee Dawood from Amr' ibn Shuayb on the authority of his father [who narrated] from his grandfather (May Allaah be pleased with him) and it is a Hasan narration. And it was also narrated in Musannaf of ibn Abi-Shaybah with an authentic Isnaad (chain) that is Mawqoof from Abdullah ibn Abbas (May Allaah be pleased with them), \"that he used to perform in Eid [prayer], seven Takbeers in the first rak'ah after the Takbeer of Beginning the prayer, and six in the second rak'ah, after the takbeer of rising up\". It is also authentically reported (by al-Bayhaqee and others) on the authority of Abdullah bin Mas'oud, \"that he used to praise Allaah (by saying Alhamdulillah) and salute the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) between every Takbeer\", so did Al-Tabarani report, and Imaam Ahmad (May Allaah have mercy on him) took it as an evidence.And if a person misses the Eid prayer, he must make it up (Qadaa) in the same description, as it was done by Anas (May Allaah be pleased with him). [The recommended deeds on the Eid day:] 1. The\u00a0\u202a#\u200eTakbeer\u202c:And it's prescribed time in Eid-ul-Fitr begins form the sunset of the Eid night (i.e. the night before the Eid day, as in the Islamic calendar, the night precedes the day) and the time ends by the Imaam's appearance (to lead the Eid prayer), Allaah says : \"(He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allaah [i.e. to say Takbir (Allahu-Akbar; Allaah is the Most Great) on seeing the crescent of the months of Ramadan and Shawwal] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him.\" [Qur'an 2:185].It was narrated in ad-Daraqutni in an authentic report, \"that Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar (May Allaah be pleased with them) used to raise his voice while reciting Takbeer, while walking towards the prayer area on Eid-al-Fitr and Eid-al-Adhaa, and he continued it until the Imaam appeared\". As for Eid-al-Adhaa, the timing for takbeer begins with the beginning of the month of Dhul-Hijjah, and ends by the sunset of the last day of Tashreeq (i.e. the 13th), and there are two types of it: Mutlaq and Muqayyad.\u2022 Takbeer al Mutlaq (Takbeer at any time) from the moment the crescent of Dhul-Hijjah is sighted, till the sunset of 13th (of Dhul-Hijjah) \u2022 Takbeer al Muqayyad (Takbeer at certain times) which is prescribed to say immediately after the obligatory prayer, from the Fajr of the day of Arafah, till the Asr of 13th. As for the pilgrim in Hajj, from the Duhur of Eid day, till the Asr of 13th.And there are several forms of takbeer, narrated by the Sahabah:One of those is what was narrated in Mussanaf of ibn Abi-Shaybah with an authentic chain, that Abdullah ibn Mas'oud used to say in the days of Tashreeq (11th to 13th of Dhul Hijjah) : \"Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, La-Ilaaha Illallaah Wallaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, Walillahil Hamd\"And in Sunan al-Bayhaqee, it was narrated with an authentic chain, that Abdullah ibn Abbaas (May Allaah be pleased with them) would say: \"Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, La-Ilaaha Illallaah Wallaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, Walillahil Hamd\". It is a sunnah to raise the voice with it in the streets, mosques and at homes. \u00a02.

The authors had the opportunity to talk to the audience about their work, inspirations and future plans. Abdullah Fakhro is a university student. He published his first novel \u201cMasks of Human Beings\u201d in 2011. He then published his second novel \u201cHope Taught Me\u201d. This novel was quite different from the first in its significantly more mature style and narrative. The author participated in the book fair in Doha in 2012 with Dar Al Qalam and then joined Dar Platinum Book Print and Publishing, a publisher that supports young Arab writers. \u201cEmpire of F\u201d is the first novel he released in cooperation with this publishing house. Aisha Jassim AlKuwari is an expert in the field of culture and Secretary of State Award for Children\u2019s Literature at the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage.

Qatari spouses in the age group of 20-29 account for 37 percent of the divorces, while those in the 30-39 age group account for 34.4 percent.\u00a0 Those in the below-20 age group account for just 0.4 percent of the divorces due to the small number of spouses in this age group. As for non-Qatari spouses, those in the age group of 30-39 account for the largest number of divorces \u2014 47.2 percent. Among Qatari wives, 49.4 percent of the divorces involve those in the 20-29 age group, while in 28.8 percent of the cases those in the 30-39 age group are involved.\u00a0 As for non-Qatari wives, those aged 20-29 account for 40.8 percent of the divorces.\u00a0 The figures are from the latest report on \u2018Qatar\u2019s Marriages & Divorces\u2019 released by the Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics with support from the Supreme Judiciary Council. Sixty percent of the divorces in 2011 occurred during the first five years of marriage and before consummation.\u00a0 Those married for more than 20 years had the lowest number of divorces.\u00a0 Among those married for five to nine years, there was a 0.7 percent increase in this figure in 2011, to 17.8 percent, compared to 2010. Figures for divorces according to the number of wives under a marriage bond show that 93.8 percent of the divorce cases among Qatari husbands in 2011 involved men who had no other wives under a marriage bond.\u00a0 Those who had another wife accounted for 5.4 percent of the cases. This ratio was the same for non-Qatari husbands. The data further indicate that 48.1 percent of the divorces that occurred before consummation were minor irrevocable divorces, whereas revocable divorce constituted 23.2 percent and divorces against compensation 28.8 percent of the total. By age group, Qatari wives aged 20 to 24 accounted for the highest percentage of divorce cases before consummation, while among non-Qatari wives those in the 20-29 age group were involved in most of the cases. Among Qatari and non-Qatari husbands, those in the 25-29 age group were involved in the largest number of divorce cases before consummation.\u00a0 As for divorce during the first four years of marriage, Qatari men and Qatari and non-Qatari women aged 25 to 29 accounted for the largest number of cases, while among non-Qatari men this was true for those aged 30 to 34. In 2011, the majority of divorce cases occurred between spouses who did not have children (69.1 percent of total divorces by the number of children), followed by spouses with one child (nine percent), and spouses with two children (7.2 percent).\u00a0 On the educational status of Qatari divorcees, the report says high school graduates \u2014 260 men and 318 women \u2014 accounted for most of the cases. The divorce rate fell among Qatari nationals during the period 2002-2005. It dropped from 9.8 per 1,000 nationals in 2002 to 7.4 in 2005 for women, before climbing to 8.7 in 2011. Among men, the divorce rate dropped from 11.2 per 1,000 in 2002 to 8.5 in 2005, later increasing to 10.0 in 2011. The study shows a rise in cases of \u201crevocable\u201d divorce, in which the husband may cancel the divorce and return to his wife without a new contract, by 48.7 percent and minor irrevocable divorce (when the first and second divorce is accomplished) by 42.5 percent. The results show a decrease in the number of major irrevocable divorces (the third divorce, which is irrevocable except the ex-wife is legitimately married to another one and divorces) by 2.9 percent and in divorce against compensation (divorce occurs at the wife\u2019s request in return for an amount of money) by 5.9 percent. On marriages, the ministry\u2019s report says the marriage rate for Qataris aged 15 and above increase during the period 2002-2006.\u00a0 It rose from 32.2 per 1,000 nationals in 2002 to 34.8 in 2006 among Qatari men, and among Qatari women it climbed from 29.8 per 1,000 in 2002 to 34.0 in 2006.\u00a0 It then fell to 24.3 for men and 23.5 for women in 2010 before climbing slightly to 25.1 for men and 24.1 for women in 2011.\u00a0 The overall decline can be attributed to the high level of women\u2019s education and their strong access to the labour market, in addition to the high cost of marriage. First-time marriages account for 84.2 percent of all the marriages.\u00a0 Widows and divorced women are involved in 15.8 percent of the marriages.\u00a0 The percentage of Qatari wives who had not married before amounted to 84.2 percent, whereas the figure was 15.4 percent for divorced women and 0.4 percent for widows.\u00a0 Non-Qatari wives who had never married before accounted for 89 percent of the marriages, whereas 10.6 percent of the marriages involved divorced women and 0.4 percent involved widows. There was an increase in the percentage of marriage contracts of husbands who did not have another wife (93.5 percent) compared to the marriage contracts of husbands who had one or more wives (6.5 percent).\u00a0 The proportion of those who had only one wife was 93.6 percent among Qataris and 93.4 percent among non-Qataris. Six percent of Qataris and 6.5 percent of non-Qataris had another wife.\u00a0 Fewer than 0.4 percent of Qataris and 0.1 percent of non-Qataris had two or three wives."}

This was the gist of discussions at a Ramadan tent at a family \u2018majlis\u2019 of Yusuf Sultan Al Majid.\u00a0 It is common this Ramadan to see private \u2018majalis\u2019 (living rooms) of prominent Qatari families taking up key social and economic issues for debate at Ramadan tents. The income of Qatari families is consistently going up and Qatari public servants are among the highest paid government sector employees in the world, debaters said at Al Majid\u2019s Ramadan tent. According to local Arabic daily Al Arab, debaters noted with some concern that the Qatari youths were being distracted by social media. They were spending more time entertaining themselves with social media than spending time with their families and society in general. \u201cWe want to guide the youth. They should get into jobs after education and marry at an early age and begin their lives,\u201d said Hassan Mehdi Al Khayyat. The youths aren\u2019t focusing on religion and society any more. They are least concerned with building their families, Al Khayyat added.\u00a0 They travel overseas for fun and frolicking almost twice a year. \u201cBut we are not against their changing lifestyle. What we want is that they follow into the footsteps of their forefathers, get married at an early age and begin their lives,\u201d said Al Khayyat."}

As a precursor to the ambitious plans to develop the \u2018Qatar brand\u2019 of dates, the ministry, for the first time, launched a \u201cfestival of fresh and dry dates\u201d yesterday. The festival at Ezdan Mall runs until August 16 and will be an annual event.\u00a0 The date harvest season has just begun and 20 varieties of local dates are on display at the festival, which attracted a large number of visitors on the first day. \u201cAs of now, local production is covering just 70 percent of total demand. The ministry has plans to make the country self-sufficient by boosting production.\u00a0 \u201cWe have lined up a series of projects to increase the quality and quantity of local production,\u201d said Yousef Al Khulaifi, Director, Agricultural Affairs, at the ministry. As part of promoting the date palm sector, the ministry has planned to launch an awareness campaign to highlight the nutritional values of dates and the need to include the fruit in the daily menu of people.\u00a0 \u201cOur campaign will focus on the need for families bringing traditional and natural food back to their dining tables. It is important in this age of people running after junk foods and risking their health. The date\u2019s nutritional and medicinal values would be highlighted during the campaign,\u201d said Massoud Jarallah Al Marri, Head of the \u00a0department. He said the campaign to promote natural food would be the nucleus of future annual \u2018dates festival\u2019.\u00a0 The next editions of the festivals will showcase how the new technologies can boost the production of dates. Qatar Foundation has launched a QR15m date palm research to improve the genetic traits of local verities of dates. The ministry will announce more funds during the next festival to boost production. The Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar and the Biotechnology Centre at the \u00a0Ministry of Environment are working to develop Qatar as an emerging leader in date palm horticulture and biotechnology applications.\u00a0 The strategic plan is to stimulate research for advanced technology and knowledge transfer, sustainable and improved date production systems, productive date varieties and to investigate health benefits of date-enriched food diets. In 2010, Qatar had an estimated 144,000 date producing palm trees spread across 335,000 hectares."}

Early inhabitants, much like Qataris throughout recorded history, relied on the sea for their living. Archaeological finds include painted pottery traded from Mesopotamia, fish bones and traps, and flint tools. In the 1700s, Arab migrants settled along the coast of Qatar to begin pearl diving. They were ruled by the Bani Khalid clan, who controlled the coast from what is now southern Iraq through Qatar. The port of Zubarah became the regional capital for the Bani Khalid and also a major transit port for goods. The Bani Khalid lost the peninsula in 1783, when the Al Khalifa family from Bahrain captured Qatar. Bahrain was a center for piracy in the Persian Gulf, angering the officials of the British East India Company. In 1821, the BEIC sent a ship to destroy Doha in revenge for Bahraini attacks on British shipping. The bewildered Qataris fled their ruined city, not knowing why the British were bombarding them; soon, they rose against Bahraini rule. A new local ruling family, the Thani clan, emerged. In 1867, Qatar and Bahrain went to war. Once more, Doha was left in ruins. Britain intervened, recognizing Qatar as a separate entity from Bahrain in a settlement treaty. This was the first step in establishing a Qatari state, which took place on December 18, 1878. In the intervening years, however, Qatar fell under Ottoman Turkish rule in 1871. It regained some measure of autonomy after an army led by Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammad Al Thani defeated an Ottoman force. Qatar was not fully independent, but it became an autonomous nation within the Ottoman Empire. As the Ottoman Empire collapsed during the course of World War I, Qatar became a British protectorate. Britain, from November 3, 1916, would run Qatar's foreign relations in return for protecting the Gulf state from all other powers. In 1935, the sheikh got treaty protection against internal threats, as well. Just four years later, oil was discovered in Qatar, but it would not play a major role in the economy until after World War II. Britain's hold on the Gulf, as well as its interest in empire, began to fade with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. In 1968, Qatar joined a group of nine small Gulf nations, the nucleus of what would become the United Arab Emirates. However, Qatar soon resigned from the coalition due to territorial disputes, and became independent on its own on September 3, 1971. Still under Al Thani clan rule, Qatar soon developed into an oil-rich and regionally influential country. Its military supported Saudi units against the Iraqi Army during the Persian Gulf War in 1991, and Qatar even hosted Canadian coalition troops on its soil. In 1995, Qatar underwent a bloodless coup, when Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani ousted his father from power and began to modernize the country. He established the Al Jazeera television network in 1996, allowed the construction of a Roman Catholic church, and has encouraged women's suffrage. In a sure sign of Qatar's closer ties with the west, the emir also allowed the US to base its Central Command on the peninsula during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. In 2013, the emir handed over power to his son, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani."}

The majority of the etchings are of boats, with European, Indian and locally-made vessels among them.\u00a0 Working alongside Mr Faisal Al Naimi, head of archaeology at Qatar Museums and Mr Tom Collie of the University of Copenhagen, specialists at the University of Exeter Dr John Cooper and Professor Dionisius Agius have spent a year studying the enigmatic depictions of boats found etched on the wall plaster of buildings at the site.\u00a0 The team studied fifteen different images and concluded that they represent boats from across the world including a probable European war vessel, a locally made fishing vessel and trade dhows traditionally made on the Malabar Coast of India. In a presentation at the British Museum in London, Dr Cooper demonstrated that the etchings were made on dry plaster, within finely plastered buildings at the site.\u00a0 Although some of the images are only rudimentary outlines of hulls, others show enough detail to identify their type.\u00a0 These tend to depict large ocean-going ships which were used for trade in the Arabian Gulf and Indian Ocean region. The technical detail of the rigging, rudders and other aspects of the etchings show that the graffiti artists must have had an intimate knowledge of these vessels, emphasising their close relationship with the sea. Some of the dhow etchings have already been removed from the site by specialist plaster conservators for consolidation and further treatment in the laboratory, while others have been re-buried to protect them from the elements.\u00a0 A plaster impression of one of the removed etchings can be seen in the temporary exhibition at Al Zubarah. Al Zubarah Archaeological Site became Qatar\u2019s first UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013 and is open to the public every day 9am-4:30pm.

Speaking to Doha News, local comedian Hamad Al-Amari, who co-starred in the video with a camel named Jim, said the idea of taking the animal through a drive-through had been kicking around in his head for two years. \u201cI just finally got the chance to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that this was something the world would laugh at, not just Qataris or people living in Qatar.\u201d The video was produced by local production company Red Monkey, which Al-Amari said procured the camel as part of the deal. It was filmed at the Burger King at the roundabout of the same name last weekend. Red Monkey explained what happened during filming: \u201cThe lady manning the drive thru was most surprised to be confronted by a man on a camel requesting a \u2018cheeseburger.\u2019 She called for her manager who provided the cheese burger whilst giggling. The manager also took a few pictures for his friends on Facebook and wished the camel and his man a good day. Local Qatari police later arrived on the scene but took no action against a man getting some cheeseburgers with his Camel. Hamad was quoted as saying \u2018haven\u2019t you seen a man and his camel before\u2019 much to the amusement of the police.\u201d On Twitter, reaction to the video has been largely one of delight However, for those who feel like the video stereotyped Qatari culture (the camel is a symbol of Qatar\u2019s formerly bedouin lifestyle), Al-Amari has a response: \u201cSometimes comedy offends people,\u201d he said. But he added that his intention was simply to put a smile on people\u2019s faces. Al-Amari said residents can look forward to seeing him perform more crazy stunts in the future. Thoughts?

Doha has a specialist Falcon Hospital in the popular Souq Waqif where injured birds are treated. According to a recent report on the  , this hospital has 30 vets and staff from around the world. It caters to the needs of falcons and their deep-pocketed owners, passionate players in this ancient sport of kings. Qatar is so rich they have a hospital that's exclusively for falcons \"Falcons are very brave birds and will attack anything so sometimes they come in to us damaged,\" Mohammed, a medical engineer, told the  . If your falcon is missing a feather or two after a nasty scrap with a houbara bustard, not a problem. The hospital has a well-stocked feather bank. A broken wing? Whisk the bird off to orthopaedic surgery. Digestion issues? Time for a fecal and blood check. If that doesn't do the trick, perhaps pharmaceutical and toxicology analysis is the answer. What does this sort of treatment cost? A check-up costs QAR 100 riyals and an X-ray will cost only QAR 20. \"We get people coming from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and all over the Gulf bringing their falcons in here,\" Mohammed said. The falcon hospital is just one of many signs that this once sleepy village of pearl divers and fishermen has become an astonishingly rich Arab city. (Cover photo:"}
