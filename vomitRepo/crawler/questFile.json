We don't think we can have a live-in maid. The question is:  1) Does anyone have any agencies they would recommend for a Part-time maid? 2) If the maid works \"10hrs / 6 days\" how much would the rate be? Any names & numbers would be useful.

But if it is unlimited contract (like we all currently have) then employee or employer can terminate with one month notice pay or notice period and there is going to be no pan for this type of contracts anymore and employees can come back even the next day after cancelling their residence permit and leaving the country without NOC from current employer. But he cannot transfer the current residence permit before completing his 2 or 5 years contract without NOC even if it is unlimited period contract. New Law Brief Qatar Ministry of labor has done preparation for the new rule and regulations of the labor laws related to entry and Exit of Expatriates and this will starts implementation from\u00a013th of December of year 2016. These Changes really transform lives of common worker in Qatar as this laws totally convert kafala system to Contract based System. Everything written in contract is applicable rest of the things were deducted. Executive regulations are bye-laws that explain each article of a law and explain in detail how they are to be put in force. The law (Number 21 of 2015) regulating the entry, exit and residency of foreign workers was issued late last year, amending a previous legislation. Law\u00a0Number 21 of 2015, which abolishes the stipulations of Law Number 4 of 2009 regarding Regulation of the Expatriates Entry, Departure, Residence and Sponsorship, was issued on October 27 last year. Among other changes, the new law abolishes the\u00a0current two-year ban\u00a0on expatriates who want to come back to the country on a new visa. Presently it requires a no-objection certificate from the previous employer for a former resident to take up a new job in Qatar. The new legislation will replace the sponsorship system and make the employment and stay of expatiates here entirely contract-based. Job contract will need to be signed by a foreign worker before he lands here once the new law is in effect from later this year. Also, employment contracts of all expatriate workers who are already here will be replaced with new contracts. In other words, all expatriate workers will have to sign new contracts with their employers in compliance with the provisions of the new law (No 21 of 2015). \u201cSince the new law abolishes kafala (sponsorship system), a person who had previously worked in Qatar would not have to seek the approval of his former sponsor if he is recruited by a new employer,\u201d Brigadier Mohamed Ahmed al-Atiq, assistant-director general of the Department of Border, Passport and Expatriates Affairs, had said while explaining the salient features of the new law. \u201cA foreign worker who has got a new contract to work in Qatar can come back even the next day, provided he has met the other requirements like visa,\u201d he had said. This contract will form the basis of the relationship between a foreign worker and his employer. The contract will be signed for two or five years\u2019 duration and both the sides will be obliged to follow its clauses that will contain terms and conditions. Once the new law is in effect, the exit permit system whereby a foreign worker needs written permission from his sponsor to travel overseas will also end. A worker would only need to inform his employer about his departure. According to Article 26 of the new law, if a foreign worker is fired as a punitive measure and he did not appeal his dismissal or his plea was rejected by a court, he shall not be permitted to come back to Qatar before the passage of four years. Also, an expatriate worker repatriated upon a court verdict cannot come back unless he got the approval of the Minister of Interior. According to the new law, expatriate workers can change jobs with government permission, either after the expiry of their contracts or after five years of service with their employer in case of open-ended contracts. For changing of jobs before the expiry of contract, the new law stipulates that the expatriate worker has to get the approval of the employer, alongside the concerned government entities. The new law also enables expatriate workers to apply exit permits themselves through the approved channels of the Ministry of Interior, without having to seek the permission of the employer. The request would be granted within three working days. In cases of emergency and the mutual agreement of both the worker and the employer the exit permit will be granted immediately. According to new law no approval from former employer is required if he is recruited by a new employer. An expat can also move to another sponsor with the approval of MOI and MOLSA if the sponsor is dead or the company no longer exists for any reason. 16 things you need to know about new law kafala changes 1.\u00a0New law would be implemented by this year 2016.(updated) 2.\u00a0New law will make employment and stay of expatiates entirely contract-based. 3.\u00a0Two-year ban on a new work visa will no longer be applicable. 4.\u00a0No approval from former employer if he is recruited by a new employer. 5.\u00a0Worker who has got a new contract to work in Qatar can come back even on the next day. 6.\u00a0Exit permit will not be required for travel it will become invalid with enforcement of new law. 7.\u00a0To leave country employee needs to inform his employer before three days and apply through in Metrash 2 system. 8.\u00a0All employment contracts of all expatriate workers who are already here will be replaced with new contracts by the end of this year. 9.\u00a0Date he has signed the fresh employment contract will be the date from his contract would be counted. 10.\u00a0Employment contract has to approved by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. 11.\u00a0Closed contracts shall not exceed a period of five years. 12.\u00a0Employes with Open-ended contracts can move to another employer after spending a minimum of five years with the first employer. 13.\u00a0Workers with fixed job contracts can change their work and sign new contracts if they wish so at the end of the contract period without any NOC but approval from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. 14.\u00a0An expat can also move to another sponsor with the approval of MOI and MOLSA if the sponsor is dead or the company no longer exists for any reason. 15.\u00a0QR50,000 fine and jail terms of up to three years for recruiters who allow their employees to work for other parties without prior official approval. 16.\u00a0QR10,000 to QR25,000 fine for keeping passport of expatriate employee.", "username": "Syed01@yahoo.com", "commentId": "comment-7414986"}, {"comment": "@syed thanks for your reply. his medical test is over. if he resigb after Dec13, did he come back with another visa? bt someone told me that in new rule it state that, person have to work for two years and then after he dnt need any noc to join in another company.is it true? and main thing is, my friends present company make him ti sign on Unlimited contract preiod. he did sign. is there any problem after rule arraivs", "username": "Jayakumargosangi", "commentId": "comment-7414486"}, {"comment": "RP means Resident Permit Card.

In my last five years of driving, I have noticed that a lot of drivers on the road (including expats) expect all other cars to move over as per their convenience and at his desired speed. The roads must be open for him/her and has no courtesy to give way to fellow drivers despite knowing that there's ongoing constructions every where.The large SUVs think it's their right to honk at each and every person on road. All though I encourage the use of horn when appropriate to avoid danger but their use must not become a fashion such as flashing the lights which has already become one. I have also seen number of drivers getting involved in road rages because of using unnecessary horns because you probably don't know who you're honking at. Rant over. Please do comment\u00a0 so as to know whether my thinking is right or wrong. Even negative comments are appreciated.", "username": "fgnhgn"}

You won't expect it to happen but when it happens it happens. A QLer recently shared his experience and the steps he had to go through to replace his residency card (Qatar ID). You may or may not go through the exact same steps depending on your visa type.\u00a0 \u00a0 The following steps particularly apply to those under a  visa. However, the procedure for replacing a lost residency card (Qatar ID) is almost similar across all visa types.\u00a0 1. Take a copy of the lost Qatar ID (if available) and the original passport of ID holder along with the original ID of the sponsor. If you do not have a copy of the lost ID, you will at least need the Qatar ID numbers. 2. Head over to one of the Immigration Service Centers (Gharrafa, Mesaimeer, Rayyan) during morning hours starting 7am and ideally before noon. Apparently they do not process lost Qatar IDs in the afternoon. SURPRISE!! 3. Go to the lost ID section and submit the documents there. They will process your request for a replacement and give you a document in Arabic. 4. Now take a token from the issuing counter. You will be summoned to the \"Lost ID\" counter 5. You will be charged QAR200 for replacing a Qatar ID. They don't accept cash so you will need a debit/credit card. : If you're sponsored by a company, you will need a NOC in Arabic (a letter requesting for replacement) from the company. You do NOT require a police report for Qatar ID replacement.", "username": "Qatar Living"}

They were on time that day but had to be supervised and all calculations had to be double checked, as they made a mistake that would have cost me more than 1,000 extra. Since then I haven't received any documentation or even an ETA. Nothing. Despite many phone calls, visits and emails by myself, friends in Doha and even a lawyer, I only got a couple of emails promising me I'd receive something the next day but then again nothing.  Please, if anyone is moving out of Doha any time soon, make sure they don't use Agape.

I guess even some of them might use reticently but most of them still not even aware of it at all. However here I am going to publish a series of short articles which might come useful for the companies who still not aware of Big Data Potential. Well the initial question might like, WHAT IS \u201cBIG DATA\u201d ANYWAY? According to Wikipedia it is\u2026 Does it make sense? If not enough then read my favorite one that I often point as the \u201cpractical\u201d definition to Big Data\u2026 Big data is a term used to describe the collection, processing and availability of huge volumes of streaming data in real-time. Companies are combining marketing, sales, customer data, transactional data, social conversations and even external data like stock prices, weather and news to identify correlation and causation statistically valid models to help them make more accurate decisions. Yeah that\u2019s glittering? Now this is time to see one practical example of Big Data\u2026 Back in 1980 Wall Street shop keepers start complaining that every Saturday they find lowest sales than other days of a week! But surprising fact is their accountants report revenue of Saturday is just as usual as other days of week! That was pretty amazing! However some shopkeepers agreed to exchange their daily sales data to reveal actually what was getting traction and what is happening overall. The result of accumulation was pretty ridiculous! When they did some joint surveys they found every Saturday moms are buying baby diapers and putting those diapers in front of shops to be picked up by their husbands! For some unknown reasons parents were buying baby diapers only on Saturday. They were spending their outmost daily budget on baby diapers at Saturday so even though sales revenue from other products were down still gross sale is indicated as usual as other days of week. Actually this small piece of data can be extremely beneficial if you are willing to run a data driven business. Depending on this information you can take decision to store more diapers than any other products on Saturday. This might even increase your gross revenue at the end of the week. Therefore decisions can be influenced by Big Data. Larger companies already realized it that\u2019s why they are putting a lot of money to get data from social medias and statistical consulting firms. On my next article I would point 10 practical advantages of Big Data which would put you 10 years ahead of your competitors. Mohammad Shahadat Hossain IT Engineer", "username": "shahadat.hossain"}

{"comments": [{"comment": "Dear Sir, Here's some useful advice about how to get a health card. First, you must have a valid Qatar residency permit. To apply for a health card you will need to supply the following documents with your application: - Copy of applicant's passport - Qatar ID (issued when you get your RP) - Two photographs (4x3 cm, blue background) - QR100 fee - Copy of water and electricity bill to confirm your address - Children need valid birth certificates and vaccination cards Once you have gathered all the documents you need and completed the application form, it is time to find your nearest primary medical centre. Remember to take all your documents and make sure you go in the morning, as they do not accept health card applications in the afternoon. Early morning is best, as each centre will have a different cut-off time for accepting applications. Once you have submitted your application forms, your health cards will be issued on the spot ( In some cases, the card can be collected within 2 weeks). Children born in Qatar do not require a health card and all medical treatment and medicines are free for their first year courtesy of HMC. Renewing your health card is a simple process and can be done immediately at all HMC health centres and hospitals. You can also renew your health card online or at any Qatar General Post Office. If renewed online or at the post office, the card will be delivered within two to three weeks of submitting the application.

But what about regular middle-income expats, or even higher-salaried ones? Everyone has rights, and NHRC is here to ensure that your rights are taken care of. The National Human Rights Committee (NHRC) is a government-appointed human rights commission based in the State of Qatar. Established in 2002, it has been tasked with the responsibility of overseeing and carrying out investigations on human rights abuses in the country. The commission's aims revolve around raising awareness of human rights abuses, monitoring and observing human rights abuses, and empowering individuals. Their means of advancing this goal include contributing to research programs related to human rights, conducting studies and providing advice and recommendations to legislative bodies. The NHRC also advocates for the rights of individuals with disabilities. Expat life in Qatar is not without its problems, and while a lot of people do not, or are too scared to avail NHRC services, this organization has come to the rescue of a large number of expats and migrant workers. Be it employment issues, payment problems, or any thing that can be classified as human rights' violations, the NHRC does its due diligence in ensuring that all needs are met. For those who are wondering, you do not have to file any official complaints, and the NHRC is available just for a consultation as well. You can walk in during their operating hours from 7am \u2013 1pm and ask them or discuss whatever your problems might be. The men's section is usually crowded, and the wait might be longer, however the ladies section is fairly free, and the staff addressing your issues will be women as well. There is no fee and services are provided free of charge. They also do not ask for any personal information like ID card number, passport etc, while discussing your troubles. If you think you are in trouble, do not hesitate to reach out to them. NHRC might be the best option for you, to get any kind of help in resolving the situation you are in.

There's a huge difference between network marketing and pyramid schemes. Learn the truth here. Q: Some friends continue to try to recruit me into network marketing deals that seem like some type of money game or pyramid. Other friends tell me they're illegal and I'll get into trouble. How do I know what's legal and legitimate? A: To help you understand what network marketing is, I must first explain what it isn't. First, network marketing isn't a pyramid scheme. Pyramids are programs similar to chain letters where people just invest money based on the promise that other people will put in money that will filtrate back to them and somehow, they'll get rich. A pyramid is strictly a money game and has no basis in real commerce. Normally, there's no product involved at all, just money changing hands. Modern-day pyramids may have a product, but it's clearly there just to disguise the money game. Network marketing is a legitimate business. First, it's based on providing people with real, legitimate products they need and want at a fair price. While some people do make a lot of money through network marketing, their financial benefit is always the result of their own dedicated efforts in building an organization that sells real products and services. Pyramids are illegal and are based on taking advantage of people. For a person to actually make money in a pyramid scheme, someone else has to lose money. But in network marketing, each person can multiply his or her efforts, skills and talents by helping others be successful. Network marketing has proved itself as part of the new economy and a preferred way to do business here and around the world. Network marketing isn't about taking advantage of your friends and relatives. Only a few years ago, network marketing meant retailing to, and sponsoring people from, your \"warm list\" of prospects. Although sharing the products or services and the opportunity with people you know is still the basic foundation of the business, today we see more people using sophisticated marketing techniques such as the Internet, conference calling and other long-distance sponsoring techniques to extend their network across the country. Network marketing isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. Of course some people do make large amounts of money very quickly. Many would say those people are lucky. But success in networking isn't based on luck. (Unfortunately, money won't sprout wings and fly into your bank account no matter what someone has promised you.) Success in network marketing is based on following some very basic yet dynamic principles. Now let's discuss what network marketing is. Network marketing is a serious business for serious people. It's a proven system where the design, creation and expense the corporate team has gone through becomes a road map for your own success. Just follow the simple, proven and duplicable system that the good companies provide. The real key is this: Network marketing is all about leverage. You can leverage your time and increase the number of hours of work effort on which you can be paid by sponsoring other people and earning a small income on their efforts. J. Paul Getty, who created one of the world's greatest fortunes, said \"I would rather make 1 percent on the efforts of 100 people than 100 percent on my own efforts.\" This very basic concept is the cornerstone of network marketing. For example, most successful people building a network marketing business do so in an organized method. They work a few dedicated hours each week, with each hour of effort serving as a building block for their long-term business growth. Then they sponsor other people and teach those people how to sell the company product and sponsor others who duplicate the process. By helping the people you personally sponsor to sponsor others, you duplicate yourself. As this process continues, you create compound growth that can lead to hundreds or even thousands of people coming into your business. You leverage your time by helping others be successful and earn an income from all their efforts. With network marketing, there are no big capital requirements, no geographical limitations, no minimum quotas required and no special education or skills needed. Network marketing is a low-overhead, homebased business that can actually offer many of the tax advantages associated with owning your own business. Network marketing is a people-to-people business that can significantly expand your circle of friends. It's a business that enables you to travel and have fun as well as enjoy the lifestyle that extra income can provide. Michael L.
