{"question": "Hello everybody, \nI'm an egyptian \u2013 italian lady living in Italy and I'm looking for a job in Qatar and so now I'm applying for vacancies there. I know that, as it happens in some arab countries, after arriving in Qatar it's necessary to pass some medical tests, including chest X ray and blood exams. That's my case. About 2 years ago, I got a job offer from Saudi Arabia as beautician so after arrival, I passed the prescribed medical exams. Unfortunately I discovered to be HCV antibodies positive so they immediately let me come back to Italy. I didn't know to be infected so I immediately asked for more accurate blood tests when arrived in Italy in a specialized public hospital. While the HCV antibodies test remained positive, the RNA test was negative for 2 times, so the physician told me that according to the most recent international medical literature, approximately 15%\u201325% of persons clear spontaneusly the virus from their bodies without treatment and do not develop chronic infection and that the reasons for this are not well know. Unfortunately the antibodies remain in the blood for life long so any test will be always positive. The italian hospital gave me a detailed screening certificate to send to the saudi arabian employer, showing I was one of such cases so not infective, but the saudi medical commission was inflexible, stating summarily that I was HCV infected and not suitable for any job there. In my humble opinion I found this response not professional as the saudi medical commission based its judgment only upon antibodies test result, not investigating more with accurate tests like RIBA or RNA. Also they looked not to be respectful of their italian colleagues' opinion. After this occurrence, I passed another RNA test, obviously negative. At the end of 2011 I got a baby and also the RNA test I made in Egypt during the pregnancy was negative, confirming once again I don't have any HCV infection running. I would like to know if with this clinical condition I have some chance to get a working visa in Qatar or I have to give it up, because the medical commissions there act like the saudi arabian ones. I really hope they don't, giving me the opportunity to overcome any doubt about my health. I tried many times to contact by e-mail the Supreme Council of Health in Qatar but the address seems not working nor they replied me on its Facebook page. \nAnyone could help me, please?

The Hebrew scriptures are read (in translation) every Sunday in many churches all around the world. In contrast Islam\u2019s treatment of the Bible is one of complete disregard. Although it purports to \u2018verify\u2019 all earlier prophetic revelation, the Qur\u2019an is oblivious to the real contents of the Bible. The claim that Christians and Jews deliberately corrupted their scriptures is made without evidence, and this only serves to cover up the Qur\u2019an\u2019s historical inadequacies.

However we also believe that as time went by the true teachings of each Prophet was distorted and hence Allah kept sending messengers after messengers, reinforcing the original message of the Prophets before them. So no we don't believe that Muhammad claimed Jesus's message was false, rather we believe he preached to his followers the same original message.And so we believe that God actually wished to remove our misguidance, doubts and confusions by sending down different Prophets, and not cause any! Bare in mind we to believe in Jesus, Isa(Peace be upon him) to be our Prophet, and the one who will be sent back down to earth to slay the anti Christ and save us from his evil trials. We believe in practically everything you believe except in the trinity, and that Jesus was crucified. And finally, as for the Quran and Islam, we believe it to be the last and final religion sent by God. Again reinforcing the message of all those previous scripture.

New research on higher animals from primates and elephants to mice shows there is a biological basis for behavior such as co-operation, said de Waal, author of The Age of Empathy: Nature's Lessons for a Kinder Society. Until just 12 years ago, the common view among scientists was that humans were \"nasty\" at the core but had developed a veneer of morality - albeit a thin one, de Waal told scientists and journalists from some 50 countries at the conference in Vancouver, Canada. But human children - and most higher animals - are \"moral\" in a scientific sense, because they need to co-operate with each other to reproduce and pass on their genes, he said. Research has disproved the view, dominant since the 19th century, typical of biologist Thomas Henry Huxley's argument that morality is absent in nature and something created by humans, said de Waal. And common assumptions that the harsh view was promoted by Charles Darwin, the so-called father of evolution, are also wrong, he said. 'Pro-social' tendencies \"Darwin was much smarter than most of his followers,\" said de Waal, quoting from Darwin's The Descent of Man that animals that developed \"well-marked social instincts would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience\". De Waal showed the audience videos from laboratories revealing the dramatic emotional distress of a monkey denied a treat that another monkey received; and of a rat giving up chocolate in order to help another rat escape from a trap. Such research shows that animals naturally have pro-social tendencies for \"reciprocity, fairness, empathy and consolation,\" said de Waal. \"Human morality is unthinkable without empathy.\" Asked if wide public acceptance of empathy as natural would change the intense competition on which capitalist economic and political systems are based, de Waal quipped, \"I'm just a monkey watcher.\" But he told reporters that research also shows animals bestow their empathy on animals they are familiar with in their \"in-group\" - and that natural tendency is a challenge in a globalised human world. \"Morality\" developed in humans in small communities, he said, adding: \"It's a challenge... it's experimental for the human species to apply a system intended for [in-groups] to the whole world.\"", "subject": "Humans are 'naturally nice'"}

Neath Road in Hafod is long and narrow which means at busy times and in warmer weather, air cannot escape. Air, traffic and weather monitoring equipment will send messages to electronic signs in the city telling traffic to use other routes when pollution reaches higher levels. The system has been trialled in Sweden. In the short term, motorists will be asked to use alternative routes, but plans are in place to create a relief road in the next few years. John Hague, Swansea council's cabinet member for the environment: \"We have been monitoring air quality in the Hafod part of the city for many years after declaring the area an air quality management area. \"The latest plan will enable us to monitor traffic flows on main routes into and out of the city through Hafod, along with monitoring air quality. \"The data collected will be used to inform motorists about alternative routes during their journey. This should help improve air quality along the routes.\" Traffic problems The section of Neath Road that is affected runs from the Liberty Stadium to the traffic lights at Dyfatty. It is mostly a narrow street with terraced housing and shops running virtually all the way along it on both sides. It has suffered for a number of years with traffic problems and Hafod has been designated as an air quality management area since 2001 because pollution in the air exceeds safe levels. Continue reading the main story \u201c Start Quote It's quite dangerous for residents who live there\u201d Robert Speht Swansea councillor Heavy goods vehicles are already banned from driving on the road in 1999, and speed bumps were removed in 2007 to help ease traffic flow. Buses have also been diverted from Neath Road to another road running alongside. The new system, known as the \"Swansea Nowcaster System\" will be able to measure the traffic flow, air quality and weather in real time. It will use all the information together to determine if the pollution levels are likely to break European restrictions within a few hours. The software, which is being tailored for use in Swansea, will then be able to send messages to electronic road signs near to Neath Road which warn people to use other routes. The whole project is costing around \u00a3100,000 and is expected to start in the next few weeks. Swansea council says this is the first time in the UK that such a scheme has been used. 'Dangerous' \"The problem has got worse over the last few years,\" said councillor Rob Speht, who serves the Landore ward. \"Neath Road is a very built-up residential area. The houses are continuous along each side creating a canyon effect. \"As the cars go along the road, particularly going slowly at peak times and if it's not very breezy, a lot of the exhaust emissions cannot escape. \"It's quite dangerous for residents who live there.\" The EU restricts emissions of nitrogen dioxide and other pollutants because of their health impacts. Very high levels can cause inflammation of the lungs. In 1999, the EU set an objective for every member state to lower nitrogen dioxide levels to fewer than 40 micrograms per cubic metre of air by 2010. But many EU countries, including the UK, had problems meeting this deadline and were granted extensions until 2015. Mr Speht said \"several times\" a year the emissions along Neath Road break the law. A relief road, known as the Morfa Distributor Road, is being planned and will run from the Liberty Stadium along the River Tawe to a new housing development behind phase two of Parc Tawe shopping outlet. It is hoped the road, which is driven by private developments, would open in the next couple of years and act as an alternative route to Neath Road.

The proposed award includes USD 500,000 for the \"emotional distress\" inflicted on Shanti Gurung by Neena Malhotra and her husband Jogesh, The New York Post said. The Malhotras clearly induced their ex-maid to \"work without pay by seizing her passport and visa, restricting her ability to leave their apartment, and constantly warning her that if she travelled on her own without their permission, she would be arrested, beaten, raped and sent back to India as 'cargo',\" Manhattan federal Magistrate Judge Frank Maas was quoted as having written in his recommendation. \"We plan to go after the assets of both Mr and Mrs Malhotra. We intend to begin the process of tracking down the Malhotras' assets immediately. We hope Indian government will finally do the right thing. So far they have not. We hope they will put pressure on the Malhotras to make the appropriate compensation to Shanti Gurung It is very disturbing that they will not take the matter more seriously,\" Mr. Mitchell Alan Karlan said.  In all likelihood, the ruling is expected to be upheld by the overseeing judge in the next hearing scheduled for two weeks from now, especially since neither of the Malhotras have attended any court hearings so far, say sources. Once the recommendation is upheld by the supervising judge, it will become a judgment. (With PTI Inputs) Read more at: ", "subject": "Good lesson for other would be abusers"}

If Anne is married, the answer is A: she would be the married person who is looking at an unmarried person (George). If Anne is not married, the answer is still A: in this case, Jack is the married person, and he is looking at Anne, the unmarried person. To solve this you have to approach the problem on its own terms and think inclusively which means to consider all possibilities. Most people are educated to think exclusively which means to reduce possibilities. This kind of thinking also requires less effort.

Those opposed to the idea of hiring maids from Bosnia say since Bosnian women are charming and beautiful they might destroy Qatari homes by tempting young men. Young Qatari wives are particularly sceptical and say they don\u2019t want beautiful European women in their homes as they fear they could \u2018charm away\u2019 their husbands,  They argue that already there have been cases of good-looking Asian maids having \u2018tempted husbands away\u2019 in many a family and destroyed homes. Then, there are cases of illicit relationships between Asian maids with younger men, they further argue. They insist that if at all European maids are allowed to be recruited, stricter rules must be in place that do not permit women less than 40 years of age to enter a Qatari home as maid. Social stability might really be at stake if young and beautiful European maids are permitted to take up jobs in Qatari homes, the daily said quoting community sources. It recently reported that an agreement might be signed soon to recruit housemaids from Bosnia and Herzegovina and a host of Arab and African Countries to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on a few major maid-exporting Asian nations. .....it might reduce the cost of hiring but it has already started the he ", "subject": "Does it sound like cost cutting"}

And after autopsy, the medico-legal proclaimed: DEATH DUE TO IGNORANCE! And it was stated that she ate prawns/shrimps, while taking in vitamin C. And this (deadly) combination, according to the medico-legal, resulted to arsenic poisoing when they mixed and combined in the stomach! It is like saying that \"she ate herself to death.\" The verdict? This is a HOAX! Primarily, Arsenic is not a compound; it is an ELEMENT by itself. Therefore, if it is an element, it exists by itself, and only the amount that you ingest will determine whether or not it is poisonous. Well, there are so many poisonous or hazardous materials and minerals that we ingest everyday, we actually \"eat them\", as they are part and parcel of the food that we eat, but we don't pay them any attention. We simply eat, and tomorrow, we diet! If we diet, then it carries that we live the next day, isn't it??? So arsenic is NOT FORMED by combining Vitamin C and prawn/shrimp. It comes by its own, and doesn't need the help of anything else to make it the poison that it is. And it has to come in the right amount to kill you!

Eating shrimp/prawn is not the problem that's why nothing happened to her family even though they had the same shrimp/prawn. However at the same time the deceased also took 'vitamin C', that is where the problem was! \nResearchers found food such as soft-shell contain much higher concentration of five \npotassium arsenic compounds. \nSuch fresh food by itself has no toxic effects on the human body.However, in taking 'vitamin C', chemical reaction occurs and the original non-toxic elements change to toxic elements. \nArsenic poisoning has magma role and can cause paralysis to the small blood vessels.

Hill, who has been a bus driver for 10 years, told the court that his actions were a \u2018moment of madness\u2019. The court heard that Hill had argued with the cyclist, Phillip Mead, who accused the driver of passing him too close.

Mead, 43, can be seen cycling along the road, when suddenly the bus next to him swerves violently into his side, knocking the cyclist flying across the ground.

Lets just say I am looking for the truth.", "username": "Missteacher", "commentId": "QTLQ47125_C3"}, {"comment": "We have seen that Jesus (pbuh) greeted his disciples like a Muslim, by saying: \u201cPeace be unto you\u201d, when he appeared before them after his so-called \u2018resurrection\u2019 (John 20:19). Muslims use the same words to greet, (but in Arabic): Assalaamu Alaikum. We have also seen that the utterances of Jesus have been supportive of and predicting about the rise of Muhammad (pbuh), and through him the belief Islam and the believing nation of Muslims, to which his followers are required to join. In John 16: 12 & 13, Jesus says: \u201cI have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth; \u201d The common thing observed from the above verses is: Jesus (peace be upon him) prays to the Lord to save him from the anticipated persecution at the hands of the Jews; yet not as Jesus wishes but as the Lord wills. Do you realize what Jesus is stating at this moment? He subdues his wishes and submits himself to the will of Allah. In other words, Jesus declares his Islam, submission, at that moment. As already explained in Article 1 in this series: A Muslim is one who has submitted to the will of Allah. Islam means submission (to the will of Allah), while it also means Peace. Thus, by declaring his submission to the will of Allah, Jesus declared himself to be a Muslim. It was also mentioned in Chapter 2 that Jesus (pbuh), as also the other prophets before him, called themselves \u2018Muslims\u2019. But, then, why their followers were not named as \u2018Muslims\u2019, too? If the followers of the different other prophets were also to be called as \u2018Muslims\u2019, then there would have been confusion in distinguishing between the true Muslims (who believe in all the prophets) and the followers of other prophets (who believe in some prophets and disbelieve in the rest). Belief in all the messengers of Allah is a basic requirement to be called a Muslim. Allah tells the Muslims in Qur'an: \u201c Say (O Muslims): We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the Prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered. \u201d (2:136) Thus, Jesus (pbuh) practiced Islam, i.e., Submission and he got Islam, i.e., Peace. How? The Bible tells us in Luke 22:43 \u201c And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.\u201d This is in appreciation of his act of Submission and as an answer to his prayers. The strength at that moment but what he needed most desperately was solace and assurance from the Lord that he would be saved from the arrest and wanted the freedom to perform the things he wanted to do as a Muslim. So, Jesus the Muslim (peace be upon him) had prayed in ARABIC: \u201cYaa Ilaahi, Yaa Ilaahi, Lima Sabaqtanee? \u201d. Does the phrase sound familiar? Yes, this is what he asked the Lord at that moment. \u201cO my Lord, O my Lord, Why have you advanced me (in my end)? \u201d", "username": "Baburao-Ganpatrao-Apte", "commentId": "QTLQ47125_C4"}, {"comment": "his name is ISA PBHM and he is a muslim and the muslims follow his teachings more than the christians for eg , pork is prohibited yet how many christians eat pork?", "username": "Baburao-Ganpatrao-Apte", "commentId": "QTLQ47125_C5"}, {"comment": "Well, firstly, we do believe Jesus as our prophet, but he is clearly not son of god.

Within minutes residents in this village of stone houses gathered outside the home, and the thugs fled. \"My wife and I were terrified,\" said teacher Michael Kimotho. \"But the alarm raised by the chief helped.\" The tweet from Francis Kariuki was only his latest attempt to improve village life by using the micro-blogging site Twitter. Kariuki regularly sends out tweets about missing children and farm animals, showing that the power of social media has reached even into a dusty African village. Lanet Umoja is 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of the capital, Nairobi. \"There is a brown and white sheep which has gone missing with a nylon rope around its neck and it belongs to Mwangi's father,\" he tweeted recently in the Swahili language. The sheep was soon recovered. Kariuki said that even the thieves in his village follow him on Twitter. Earlier this year, he tweeted about the theft of a cow, and later the cow was found abandoned, tied to a pole. Kariuki's official Twitter page shows 300 followers, but the former teacher estimated that thousands of the 28,000 residents in his area receive the messages he sends out directly and indirectly. He said many of his constituents, mostly subsistence farmers, cannot afford to buy smart phones, but can access tweets through a third-party mobile phone application. Others forward the tweets via text message. \"Twitter has helped save time and money. I no longer have to write letters or print posters which take time to distribute and are expensive,\" Kariuki said. A recent report said that Twitter is enjoying big growth across Africa. It said South Africans use Twitter the most, but Kenya is second in usage on the continent. The research by Kenya-based Portland Communications and Tweetminster found that over the last three months of 2011, Kenyans produced nearly 2.5 million tweets. More than 80 per cent of those polled in that research said they mainly used Twitter for communicating with friends, 68 per cent said they use it to monitor news. Beatrice Karanja, the head of Portland Nairobi, said the findings show that the use of Twitter is part of a revolution for governments that want to open dialogue with their citizens and businesses that want to talk with their consumers. When a man in his late fifties in Kariuki's village fell into a pit latrine in December, the village administrator's tweets mobilized area residents and saved him. Rachel Bremer, a spokeswoman for Twitter, said her company wasn't aware of Kariuki and his innovative use of Twitter, but she called it \"a great one.\" \"We are constantly amazed by the ways people all over the world are using Twitter to communicate,\" she said. She said that the company has a web page dedicated to telling stories about the unique uses of Twitter. The page highlights how one man in Pakistan live-tweeted the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, how a father and daughter reunited after 11 years, and how a man raised funds to save a dog's life. Erik Hersman, a co-founder of internationally acclaimed Ushahidi, a non-profit technology company, said Kariuki's use of Twitter is a great example of how Kenyans in even the most remote areas can embrace social media. \"If a chief in upcountry Kenya is able to use and have an impact with his constituents by using tools like Twitter, it's not too long before we see a massive movement in the country with these types of social media,\" he said. Kariuki, 47, said that he has been able to bring down the crime rate in Lanet Umoja from near-daily reports of break-ins to no such crimes in recent weeks. He also uses Twitter to send messages of hope, especially for the young and unemployed. \"Let's be the kind of people that do good for others whether we get paid back or not, whether they say thank you or not,\" one recent tweet said. \nKariuki said he intends to use Twitter to promote peace as Kenya prepares to hold another presidential election in the next year, it's first since the 2007-08 postelection violence that killed more than 1,000 people in Kenya. Kariuki said that when he was first appointed the administrative chief of Lanet Umoja he asked himself how he could tackle the region's problems. First was solving the region's poor communication infrastructure. He said he is currently setting guidelines to help him sift through the information he gets so that he does not send out incorrect tweets. \"Information is power, but information can also be destructive. What we are trying to minimize is destructive information,\" Kariuki said. Source: ", "subject": "Twitter alarm in Kenya village..."}

For the record I am one of those \"teach em young\" parents. I prefer my child hear it all from me rather than being terrorized and/or lead astray from other sources. In today's times, where any and all info is available at a mere flick of a mouse, it's better our kids know the perils and ills of the world, and indeed cyber world. My daughter depends on the internet for a lot of her learning and entertainment, and is very net savvy, hence I find it better to have her educated then of how to make the best of it all and avoid the worst. And this can mean we have to also be on guard 24/7. Like recently she actually wanted to search out something that had also a sexual innuendo hence I had to quickly stop her and instead suggest to her other ways of wording her search.

Qatar Olympic Committee (QOC) had directed all sport clubs and federations to open the gates of their facilities for all community members to celebrate the day. This was in line with its strategy to promote sports, physical education and sustainable development, in compliance with Qatar National Vision 2030. \nBoth Qatari and expatriate families expressed their gratitude to HH the Heir Apparent for earmarking a day that places emphasis on healthy living. \nA Qatari employer described the National Sports Day as an \u201cinvestment as it helps his employees to refresh their bodies and minds, have a common cause to celebrate and exercise and return to work fresher and with a more friendly attitude towards each other\u201d. \nHundreds of residents and their families gathered at the Museum of Islamic Art Park to take part in sport matches organised by the QOC. \nTop government officials, including HE the Minister of Public Health Abdullah bin Khalid al-Qahtani, participated in the marches from two points at the MIA Park and from Sheraton Park, finishing at the Oryx area. \nA sports zone set up by the QOC featured table tennis, basketball, lawn tennis as well as virtual games for children. There was a tent for electronic shooting competitions in co-ordination with the Qatar Shooting and Archery Federation. \nThe event was also used to promote the concept of healthy eating. Fruits such as bananas and apples were available for free at many locations along the path of the marches. \nThe participants got a chance to check their blood sugar level, weight, height and body mass index as well as other vital signs at booths set up by the Supreme Council of Health and the Hamad Medical Corporation. \nQatar Foundation hosted fun-filled activities at four locations on the Education City grounds. As much as 1mn calories, the equivalent of a 1,250 fast food meals, were burned collectively by participants. \nQatar University organised an integrated programme of activities around the theme \u201cSports is a Lifestyle\u201d for participants, including people with special needs. \nA mini marathon hosted by QNB had 3,500 entries in addition to 4,000 other guests who participated in other activities at the QNB Fun Zone and recreation areas. \nQatar Petroleum hosted a variety of activities at Al Ghazal Club. HE the Minister of Energy and Industry Dr Mohamed bin Saleh al-Sada attended. \nHeir Apparent attends \nactivities at tennis complex  HH the Heir Apparent Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and his wife HH Sheikha Jawaher bint Hamad bin Suhaim al-Thani yesterday attended National Sports Day celebrations. They participated in sports activities being held at the Khalifa International Tennis and Squash Complex and played table tennis. HH the Heir Apparent toured the complex facilities. HH Sheikha Jawaher bint Hamad also took part in activities of the Women\u2019s Committee, held at the Aspire women\u2019s sport hall.

And perhaps next year I will engage in some activity myself having seen the positive response from those I know. I joked at one of my friends when I saw her returning home that I thought she would be off running a marathon or something this morning, and she proudly showed me the start and finish stamp on her hand. I was gob smacked! I was only joking, but she had actually gone and done it, and had enjoyed. Then in the afternoon another friend of mine returned from her company sports day. Once again I made some lame jokes, and once again I was put down when she said how much she had enjoyed it. There were many team events, and the teams were comprised of workers and all levels of management. And although she had won nothing, had enjoyed the comradeship and bonding that had taken place over the event. Then I start seeing photographs appearing online. Now my lazy day, although very enjoyable, started to feel less fulfilling than others. As the day progressed, more and more reports from people I know, of how much they had enjoyed the day. What a great idea National Sports Day is. Without the day off, this would be impossible. I saw the day as a bonus day off, but now I see it as a damn good idea.

The area provided by Qatar Tourism Authority has been made bigger and the layout is quite better for both visitors and those taking part in the food festival. Instead of the back-to-back layout of food stalls last year, they provided an open square layout where they placed some bouncing castles and play areas for kids. Food servings are still at 5-15QR. Anyway, as a whole, I\u2019m sure anybody who goes there would enjoy the festival atmosphere. They could have provided more entertainment ( a concert or two), and more seats, but it is much recommended to go to this week.

I was also one of the victims of this scam being perpetuated by Vacation international. They told us that they had operated in UAE for 13 years and are in Doha from last 2 years. They plan to move on to Oman next. I entered into a contract with them yesterday night( 25th August 2012) after being lured in the Safari mall in Qatar. They asked me a few questions and told me I had won a free trip to Egypt. They then invited me and my family to a \"carnival\" next day, where they would give out the free gifts. The gifts were a week each in two resorts in Egypt and three days in Dubai. They told us the accommodation was free and we have to pay 130QR for two meals in the hotel which again was said to be at 40% discount . This was if we accepted their package which was....that we could have 5 weeks vacation in 10 countries at a 50% discount on accomodation which would be $130 per night( full price being $270).... that is valid only if we sign the contract right then and there. So I have to pay a total of QR 18100 over 36 months paying QR 340 each month. While the signs of a scam was all around, I took the offer and paid Qr. 5940/-as 'non refundable' down payment because their offer appeared reasonable and we were planning to take a vacation anyway. At home I checked and found that the list of hotels given had hotels whose prices were only $ 80 to $150 and not $270 as they indicated. So basically we will be paying the full fare or more instead of availing a 50%.Moreover on checking I find that many of the hotels in their list do not exist any more. So I am wondering if I can do anything about it to cancel this whole contract. I saw when I got home that a lot of others were duped as well. Is any action being taken against them. I called up Safari mall and told them about it but all they replied that I can complain to the company. He washed his hands off stating that all they have done is rented the space to this 'registered' company and also added that these people are operating from many other malls in Qatar also.

To answer one of your questions\"Do we need to further enhance our consciousness or intellect to know what\u2019s beyond?\" then as Muslims,according to our beliefs, we certainly do. In fact it's something we are constantly advised to research as often as we can. Death and the hear-after. What will lie ahead of us, after our souls depart from this world. How can we achieve eternal bliss and avoid the torments and suffering of the eternal life etc while we are still alive and able. So yes..I would say we definitely should seek out knowledge of life after death. As lay people, I doubt our life can majorly affect all of mankind but I would say if we can, in any way possible, be good human beings, be of assistance and help to people as much as we can, and if nothing else avoid causing agony and harm to our fellow beings,then at least our lives will not have been insignificant to everyone. On the other hand by doing what's right and just and living and dying upon the truth and good beliefs, then either ways we have not lived in vain. We have actually made good use of our time on earth! Life will finally amount to how we chose to live it.We will all face highs and lows, and pleasures and pain. No one can be happy 24/7 and likewise no one can be unhappy all the time either. Good or bad, happy or sad, it's how we dealt with all our life's moments. Be them our blessings or trials, it's what we made of our each breath of life that will finally determine whether or not our temporally existence was one of only pleasure/pain or did we actually amount to more than that.

I decided to stay back in the car and read while my parents went inside to shop. An hour later, I heard someone tapping on the window. I looked up to see a man, of South Asian descent tapping on my window. 'Salam Aleikum,' he said when I looked up.  I lowered the window and asked him what he wanted. Realizing I was Indian, he started speaking in Urdu and narrated a extremely pitiful story of how his hand was fractured and he had no money to treat it. He asked me for some cash. I told him I hadn't any after which he began begging again and said he wanted to go back to his home country. I didn't see the relation between his swollen hand and his desire to go back to his home, but the sight of the hand was disturbing. I relented and gave him five riyals. He looked at it and walked away without a word of Thanks. He then intercepted two Caucasian women walking to their car right behind mine. I lowered the window and watched. He narrated the same story. They listened, ignored him and drove away. A few minutes later, my Father stepped out of the store. I told him about the incident. He immediately understood and told me I should not have paid him. He told me about an incident near the Family Food Center at Bombay Chowpatty where he met someone similar who showed him a 'plastic bag that ran to his kidney' and begged him for money. Out of pity, when my dad gave him QR 50 he said it was 'not enough'. A waiter at Bombay Chowpatty then warned him against that there was a gang of panhandlers, most of whom are from the Indian subcontinent, who fake medical conditions to solicit money primarily from expats. I then spied him and pointed him out at which point he began to run away.  Please do not indulge these people's requests if you encounter them. The Qatari police are supposedly on the lookout. They seem to congregate at expat heavy areas in Doha.", "subject": "Expats: Beware the Panhandlers"}
