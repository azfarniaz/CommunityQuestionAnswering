##Overview
As part of the SemEval Competition we chose to pursue SubTask B, Question-to-Question ranking which involved attempting to develop a ranking system which would return the 
10 most relevant questions when compared to a given question. 

In order to achieve this we have used two different methods so far, Latent Semantic Analysis, and Paragraph2Vec using cosine similarity. Both implementations have been performed using the gensim python library.
