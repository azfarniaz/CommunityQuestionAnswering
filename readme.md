##SemEval 2017 Task 3
***

###Tasks
From the SemEval Site:
> Our main CQA task, as in 2016, is:
> “given (i) a new question and (ii) a large collection of question-answer threads created by a user community, rank the 
> answer posts that are most useful for answering the new question.”

> Additionally, we propose two sub-tasks:

> [1] Question Similarity (QS): given the new question and a set of related questions from the collection, rank the similar 
> questions according to their similarity to the original question (with the idea that the answers to the similar
> questions should be answering the new question as well).

> [2] Relevance Classification (RC): given a question from a question-answer thread, rank the answer posts according to 
> their relevance with respect to the question.
