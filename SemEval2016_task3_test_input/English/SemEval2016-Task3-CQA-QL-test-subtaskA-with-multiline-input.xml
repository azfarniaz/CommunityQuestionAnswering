			<RelCBody>well maybe if there wasn't 1 billion of you guys trying to take the same job from those few companies. Yet the new generation is also going crazy enrolling in IT degrees... How many IT jobs you think there are in this place?

Unix and Linux are jobs for men in here.. Yes believe me, certain jobs are dedicated for each gender... an IT company that needs a Unix admin, that is 99.99% male dominated department would NEVER hire a woman.


Sorry to burst the bubble, reality is bitter

			<RelCBody>Dear and beloved brother in Islam, it is not the concept of banking per say which is forbidden in Islam, but it is the concept and dealings of ?riba? which forms the very back-bone of conventional interest-based banks, which is absolutely forbidden in Islam by Allah and His Messenger (saws).




The Islamic Banks or Islamic Financial Institutions are all based on Shariah-compliant interest-free dealings, and it would be absolutely permissible for a believer to seek employment in an Islamic Bank, if he wishes to do so.

Islamic way of banking:

Most people are so used to the conventional interest-based banking system, that in their ignorance of the laws of Shariah-compliant Islamic Economics they may at times accuse the Islamic Financial Institutions of dealing in interest or ?riba? with just a different name. 





A simple example can be cited to make the concept of ?haraam? and ?halaal? clearer.    If one marries a woman and satisfies his pleasure, it is considered ?halaal? and is a virtue in Islam.   But if one does not marry a woman and satisfies his pleasure with her out of marriage, it is considered ?haraam? and a huge sin in Islam!  Both satisfy the carnal pleasures of man, but the difference between them is a one-page or a simple verbal legal contract of marriage!!   The ignorant might say ?what is the difference??   But you and I both know, there is a huge difference in the reward and sin between the two acts, although both can be termed similar in some qualities.   But Allah Subhanah has declared marriage ?halaal? and fornication and adultery ?haraam?. 





Similarly, although it may seem to some who are ignorant of the laws of Islamic Economics that because the Islamic Bank charges a ?fee? or ?profit? instead of ?interest?, there is no difference in the permissibility of the transaction! But the truth is that because of the nature of the contract made by the Islamic Bank their transaction would be interest-free, and thus halaal in the sight of Shariah and Allah Subhanah, and the interest-based transaction of a conventional bank would be considered absolutely illegal and haraam.




If one trusts, obeys, and follows the guidance and commands of Allah and His Messenger (saws),   one can be assured of never ever being misled;   but if one believes, obeys and follows any other guidance, other than that of Allah and His Messenger (saws), one can be assured of being led astray.  





Whatever written of Truth and benefit is only due to Allah?s Assistance and Guidance, and whatever of error is of me alone.  Allah Alone Knows Best and He is the Only Source of Strength.




Your brother and well wisher in Islam,

			<RelCBody>Dear people in Islam

thankyou every one of you for your valuable answers. i did a little research on this topic and i came to know that, no matter whatever the banks are. if their capital has riba involved in it and if the banks are dealing with riba , then the business is haram. it depends on what they are dealing with. for example - all ''Q'' companies are dealing and doing business with some product so their business is halal but when some company does liquor and riba and other haram things involved in it , then it becomes haram. i also found this that: in olden days the trade used to take place between products like rice for wheat, or rice for milk or rice for sugar or other dealings which is halal, then came currency : wheat for dirhams, dirhams for rice which still is halal but when the currency came in like 1 kg of good quality gold for 3 kg of bad quality gold and people started this thing and started to cheat in this currency to currency to gold to gold , or good quality wheat for low quality wheat this became riba and which is haram.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>thanks to everyone (except 120kpm@roundabout) for your answers.  this is my second trip to doha and normally i'm in dubai when in the middle east, where they are still serving alcohol in restaurants from 19.30. 


last time i was in doha quite a lot of people told me how doha is as liberal as dubai, because of the amount of expats there, so i did think that the hotels where tourists and business expats would be would make exceptions as they do in dubai.  i have no problem not drinking, i am not much of a drinker anyway.  just sometimes is nice to have a bottle of wine over dinner.


120kph, i don't appreciate being called an idiot.  i wasn't asking for drugs or prostitutes or anything morally or legally wrong.  i asked an innocent question about a city that i've only been to once before and your comment was uncalled for. </RelCBody>

I am terribly sorry that I didn't get around to answering your phone calls or checking your emails.

As Chelsea has said, we do this out of the goodness of our hearts and no one seems to appreciate how much time of our own we give for these animals - and we seem to get nothing in return but negative feed back...

			<RelCBody>The players decide who goes first, perhaps via ip dip, (American: Eeny, meeny, miny, moe) or a variant, then the jacks are scattered loosely into the play area. The players take it in turn to bounce the ball off the surface, then pick up jacks, then catch the ball before it bounces twice.

There are variants on this procedure. Sometimes the ball is thrown into the air rather than bounced. Sometimes it is bounced against a wall or target, if that is in the vicinity of play. Sometimes no bounce is allowed at all.

In some variants, the players must pick up as many jacks as possible in each turn. Perhaps more commonly, the number of jacks to be picked up is pre-ordained and sequential: at first you must pick up one (onesies), next two (twosies), and so on.

In most versions of the game, only one hand may be used. To simplify play, both may be used; to make it harder, or to impose a handicap, a player might be required to use their off-hand (eg, the left if right-handed).

			<RelCBody>Ngourlay makes some very good points that any person thinking of investing should seriously consider.


I've been looking into the number of people coming to Qatar and the supply of property for some time. What is interesting is that demand is likely to continue to outstrip supply for the next 4-5 years. After this point, the Pearl, Lusail and other developments will come fully on stream and then I suspect property prices will come down as there will be enough supply. But on the other hand, Qatar is similar to how Dubai was in the mid 1990s. The potential is really impressive in the long term so real estate in Qatar is a good investment.

As far as Lusail goes - I've consistently heard that it is running behind schedule and will not be completed on time. The first new development which will be ready seems to be the Zig Zag towers in June/July. They still have a couple of apartments left near the top I hear so it might be a better investment than Lusail given delays etc.....</RelCBody>
			<RelCClean>Ngourlay makes some very good points that any person thinking of investing should seriously consider. I've been looking into the number of people coming to Qatar and the supply of property for some time. What is interesting is that demand is likely to continue to outstrip supply for the next 4-5 years. After this point; the Pearl; Lusail and other developments will come fully on stream and then I suspect property prices will come down as there will be enough supply.

			<RelCBody>You should not compare it to Dubai since prices in dubai when they statred selling 5 years ago were low and there was a big potential for buying, in Doha, a 2 bed appartment is selling for the same price as in dubai now, so even though there will be some upward potential, i dont think its enough to take the risk
second, when i first came here in january i was interested in buying and i went to see the buildings with al sabban towers and they said that out of three towers they still have one to be sold, 6 months later they still had few appartment in that same tower, and now they are also selling the other two which were still not sold, in dubai, a compound of 6000 villa was sold in three days.
third, between the pearl and lusail and waab cilty finishing all together, i dont think that doha is ready to fill all these empty appartments with such an inflation and people are starting to lok for other alternatives than doha


I always tell the truth, even when I lie</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I have brought on the zig Zag about 7 months ago, and it has gone up so say 300,000 ryals.

Not bad I hear you say but its paper money till you sell it, and I don't yet see an emerging sales market.


Personally I am torn now, sell when the towers are finished take a quick profit OR


Rent and hold on to it long term.

Right now I am looking at the former, if i can make even 200,000 I am happy as that is more than the bank would have given me.


We shall see, I would recommend zig zag purely because it will be finished first, the Pearl looks good long term and will be desirable.


If al Wabb is cheap then great, get in. Loisil well that really is a lonnnnng way off, at least 5 years in my opinion before it would be worth it. but as a long term bet it could be good and might actually be a better bet than the Pearl as I think that NOW its over priced. Some friends got in when prices were lower, but now is is crazy money and there will be A LOT of towers down there.

			<RelCBody>Dear aviduser,
actually the same question as already posted by navi ...&amp;quot;what is the situation for residence permit?&amp;quot; are you getting it straight after the purchasing property or need to wait until it's completion, or even something else. How is the law and rules work here? You advise will be very valid for me, since I'm too new for this place.
Congrats, for your purchase but now I'm totally confused whether it's worthy to look for Lusail or not? All these buildings won't be finished before 2010,so no return from any of the investment upon that time, which makes bank loan too heavy for me.

Any approximate expectation on rental prices for ZigZag? What is the actual prices now for apartments in these towers since you already planning to sell them soon?
Thanks.

			<RelCBody>So you hold both. But it means that you don't need exit permits any more.


Then if you quit your job you can stay move job do whatever.


This all sounds great I know but I am thinking that if you tell an employer you don't need to be sponsored they may not hire you as they have less control over you.


In my case getting rid of the Exit permit thing is a big bonus.


Zig Zag two beds are up now for about 1.9 million they were 1.6

Rental returns well I don't know, compared to Beverly Hills tower where the average is 18K I am hoping for 14-16K Hopefully.

Loisil is so long away the financing in this country does not make any sense.


Dubai was mentioned earlier, what people fail to mention with that &amp;quot;boom&amp;quot; is flats were offered with very low down payments and then nothing until completion.


This meant people with enough cash could secure hundreds of apartments each they then sold the options on these flats on for a little profit and on the cycle went, with only the person holding the flat at the completion having to pay all the money.


Now many people who ended up with the flats saw that the prices had gone up and up maybe not knowing the history of people effectively &amp;quot;trading&amp;quot; the options like shares as they was no risk for the initial investor.


So the person ends up with the flat and as we all know quality isn't great but its OK and now the person wants to rent it out, well in some areas like Jumeirah they have banned short term lets so that is out. Then he tries to sell finding that there are now over 7,000 flats in his development ALONE !!.


Now the bubble hasn't burst there yet, but see how many of these flats are changing hands now ?. After all why buy second hand when you can buy new !.

Anyway I digress, Here the terms are different you pay in installments over the period from now until completion, but the biggest chunk will be about 3 or 4 months before completion, it varies the point being you will have paid for the flat well before completion not after or at completion, here this saves the speculation but also hinders anyone thinking about long term places like Loisil or the later stages of the Pearl as you will be paying the mortgage before you can rent it.

Now this varies from bank to bank, and terms are different, for example Loisil may say you can put down a deposit now and pay the rest over 4 years, that MIGHT be the case so thats ok. I know the Pearl does not work like that.


So what to tell you. Well if you have Cash then Loisil and later stages of the Pearl all good. Its a tax free cash cow.


But financing, Zig Zag WILL be ready next year, (the lagoona mall 6 Months after that)


So you can buy and be letting within a year.


Cheers

			<RelCBody>Aviduser, I would hope that the Zigzag towers are better than Beverley Hills Tower.  I found the finishing to be awful.  In some of the bathrooms you open the door 3cm and it hits the toilet bowl!

I recently sold an apartment at The Pearl and made a million riyals profit.  I bought it early on.  The prices have gone up a lot.

			<RelCBody>It all depends on your lifestyle and what you are coming for.

You can blow off 9000Qr in a week, a month, or be able to save up to 4000 QR out of it per month.

You can rent a car for around 1600-1800 QR per month, but I would recommend buying a second hand car or a brand new one if you plan to stay here for 3-4 years, and you can pay around 750-1000QR per month and own the car.

For food and personal expenses, 2000-3000QR is what you need
so you will end up having 1000QR to shop with , and 4000QR to save!

Email me if you need more info, use my profile to email me.

			<RelCBody>Hey Djmix, well i know you're right saying that it is confidential, but we are trying to help qatarprospect.

Anyway, i also work in an Oil &amp;amp; Gas company as a Maintenance Planner, and am paid well. I would recommend you to join RasGas, where you get a Annual Ticket Fares (whether you go or not, you actually get around 4,000 more), get a Paid Annual Vacation (recieve your salary even when you are on Holidays for those Expenses), accomodation provided with free electricity and local phone call bills, and TOO much more benefits. For a Mechanical Engineer will be around QAR 26,000. And you also get to live in a world-class peaceful community, Also known as the Al Khor Community, with families of Qatargas' and Rasgas' Employees. All the benefits in RasGas are also provided in QatarGas, but RasGas has a bit more higher salary and you get monthly trips to Sealine beach resort for Quad-biking and Jet skiing, and also get PSP's, expensive mobile phones etc. Hope you get a good job and hope i've helped.</RelCBody>

I know salaries of individuals are private and confidential and it is not my intention to find out the salary of any particular individual. I merely like to know the typical salaries paid by Oil &amp;amp; Gas companies for professionals with my level of experience because I am thinking of working in Doha.

If anybody else can shed further light on this subject for me, it will be deeply appreciated.

			<RelCBody>One of the major dilemma a prospective employee faces is his / her salary requirement.

			<RelCBody>Depends on your position. 8,000 QR is quite less for an engineer. Most of Oil/Gas companies in Qatar gives up to 6 months probation periods, it depends upon your performance, maybe for only 3 months, you will get hired already as regular employee. After that, then you can bring your family in Qatar. For the other benefits, I have no idea, but probably its good because Rasgas is a big company.

			<RelCBody>VNINOH And everyone else - RASGAS Co.

First up, congrats on the offer mate,


a quick word, RASGAS is a very good company and standards of work and culture are pretty nice...

Now coming to your question...

The salary that they offer you with QR 8K Basic (having 15yrs of experience) is a TOTAL CRAP...HEAR ME MY FRIEND&amp;lt; ABSOLUTE CRAP &amp;gt;


With that kinda experience I would say a BARE MINIMUM SALARY OF 15000 QR...at a Company like Rasgas...and this my friend is purely purely Basic, cos they normall provide Housing at their Al-Khor Community for Employees and life in there is quite nice, Schooling is covered for your children, yearly air tickets for you and family, MEdical Insurance for you and members of your family, and other such extra perks and yearly bonuses and appraisals are all not included...

QR 15000K is a Bare minimum, by the way having said this, whats the position...but irrespective of that, QR 8000 is just a total waste, and DO NOT ACCEPT IT!


I'm not being racist here, but for other Nationalities they pay much higher and I think based on your experience you need to be paid and not based on where you come from, so chuck the 8000 QR and tell them to stuff right their *** !!!

Wake up people, to all those that have said this is a decent offer, this is just stupid and absolutely one of the worst offers that I have seen or heard off...

Cheers!!!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Hi I am an engineer having 16 yrs experience recently came to qatar.

8 K Basic is really very very bad salary, according to me don't accept it. Even if they provide free accomodation housing, education for kids, air ticket for family, medical etc your saving potential will maximum 5k per month, for that you no need to come here and work with rasgas.

Just refuse the offer and wait for good one!!</RelCBody>

Welcome back and any movie would be fine, how about we go to Royal Plaza? They open a new Cinema and it looks great. I check it out that day and it is so big and the place looks cool.

			<RelCBody>Hi King Edshel!
Good to be back! :o)
My vacation was really lovely-didn't have to go anywhere outside my country, instead I went for a small tour, everywhere a different place.
It's so beautiful, so green! :o)
I've enjoyed gr8 weather there. lots of sunny warm days and even few rainy ones. hmm...lovely walks in the rain!
It's nice when you go back and all the neighbours are happy and surprised to see you on the street, everyone welcomes you :o)
you know what I mean guys. it feels so nice.

about movies, sure we can go to the new place. i'm always open for suggestions. just are they playing anything good?

I am considering turning down the offer, because the salary level is wayyyy below my expectation.


I have a secure job in the UK - and I would have to give this up in return for not being any better off.

I get the feeling there is room for negotiation, but the chances of them doubling the initial offer is unlikely, I was looking at more towards 14,000 up to 18,000.

			<RelCBody>ty for the info,
The HR recruiters are hiding so many details and I  felt that they were in a rush to make me sign the contract, are you a qatar airways employee?
If yes I have another question:
In my contract I have this weird clause about housing saying that I have either 3.500qt housing allowance or an housing offred by the company and this is SOLILY a decision from QR which means that if they don't provide housing I will spend 20% of my salary on housing (apparentely I will need 10k to have a descent flat) what do you think?
who.am.i plz keep in touch would be nice if you're looking for friends with same interests.

			<RelCBody>first of all, I'm not a QA employee, just a QL junkie. It just happened that i have friends from QA and EY. why would they hide so many details from you? On the contract, you will find everything you need to know about your salary and benefits so I'm wondering why you are so confused. I don't recommend you to take the housing allowance hence accept the accommodation that QA will provide for you. If you are a bachelor, you don't need to spend 10K for a flat. I don't get most of your point. Sorry.

The problem is that if they can't find me an appartment I will end up paying it my own which will cost much more than 3500Qrs they're offred.
Here comes my question: is it possible that they don't provide housing?

You need privatization in qatar. If there can be 2 to 3 more telecom companies i am sure no one will go with Qtel if they ever decide to block VOIP tech. ARGGHHH!!!</RelCBody>

I mean WTF....The medical city was built with &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; construction methods.....it housed the atheletes ....and after that remains mysteriously closed for 2yrs (come Dec 2008) from &amp;quot;alfanu sitta&amp;quot;....and then they talk about housing problems.

So who is responsible for holding up 2000 flats in a rising rents market? HMC alone.

			<RelCBody>I don't think the problem is with HMC as far utilising the medical city building is concerned, but i don't know the details.

Similarly, housing allowance is provided to everybody who is eligible or who's contract states housing allowance. 


One problem facing HMC is that it had hired lot of staff in 2 years, mostly females, all of them now want to bring in their families and get a house from HMC.  This ain't easy.</RelCBody>

How can they plan a Big organisation without building its own housing Quaters?


If HMC doesnt expect staff to bring in their famlies they should state it in the Contract.

They are know thinking about including the single status in the contract.

I am just putting everything into picture, HMC hired many nurses in last 2 years.  When they came they were offered either housing or housing allowance.  Almost all took housing allowance, then they called their families on visit visa, once their husbands found a job in qatar, they want to forfeit housing allowance and instead they want a house from HMC.  This means thousands of units and this is not an easy job and plus estimate the rent.

By and large HMC has been favourable to its employs, i know many hospitals in gulf do not allow females to bring their families.  Plus not so long ago, no organization in qatar was even giving housing allowance to females, they either get single accomodation or nothing at all.</RelCBody>

A call from india to Qatar costs approx. Qr.6? for 10 minutes,

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
while it costs Qr.30/- for the same from qatar. They are actually getting closer and connected to our wallet at all times as their slogan says ...? Monoploy su.ks.

changed to EDGE still the same no IP address from QTEL.
I tried so many diff things, Reset all network settings Everything. Did a search and found that other people have same problem since 4.3 update. They gave some workarounds but alas that did not work.
Then I just gave up, towards the end of the day around 15:00 it just started working again, without me doing anything. I suspect its a QTel issue, but as usual they are no help.
Mines working fine again.

			<RelCBody>Two years ago, when I came to this country...someone lured me to go this this island one weekend. It costs only 20riyals (to and from the island, includes the entrance fee, i suppose)drow boat ride.


There you can relax in a lounger under the shade of the trees, watching the others swin, play volleyball or the children play in the sand. And since the beach side faces to the sea...you'll feel like you're in a tropical island away from QATAR (my opinion).


waiters are ready to take your food order. Read a book while you smoke sheesha. If you get hungry, there was a seafood restaurant for you to dine in...

It was my small heaven, my recluse whenever I feel homesick, work-stressed or just plain lazy to do anything...

NOW...IT'S JUST AN EMPTY ISLAND...and the tree there is not even a PALM TREE? :-(

			<RelCClean>Two years ago; when I came to this country...someone lured me to go this this island one weekend. It costs only 20riyals (to and from the island; includes the entrance fee; i suppose)drow boat ride. There you can relax in a lounger under the shade of the trees; watching the others swin; play volleyball or the children play in the sand. And since the beach side faces to the sea...you'll feel like you're in a tropical island away from QATAR (my opinion). waiters are ready to take your food order. Read a book while you smoke sheesha. If you get hungry; there was a seafood restaurant for you to dine in... It was my small heaven; my recluse whenever I feel homesick; work-stressed or just plain lazy to do anything... NOW...IT'S JUST AN EMPTY ISLAND...and the tree there is not even a PALM TREE? :-( What you are is what you have been; and what you will be is what you do now. - Buddha</RelCClean>

And if you want to spend money, what's wrong in going to fancy clubs &amp;amp; hotels? Isn't all this/the above the facts about a simple city life? To have these varieties?

How about the lovely Souqs with their wonderful cafes? You will enjoy them so much &amp;amp; spend very little.


Who wants noisy nightclubs, they are available. Who want a quiet glass of wine, it's available (Golf Club for example), who wants a park, an old Souq, Cafes, Malls, Shops, far beeches, exclusive beeches...all available.

			<RelCBody>In my North American university they had  the system of averaging out the grades. (It is a very complicated system, you cannot understand it and neither did I). So what happened was that I was failing, and in order to pass I needed to put all the other nerds in the course to sleep. But those jerks would study all day and never sleep and I was very much worried about the health effects on them for not sleeping.

In the end I told my professor of the Pressure on those students, so he gave all of them A Grades and me got B grade.

Here is what happened in the exam.
After one hour had passed in the exam, he told us if anyone of you wants to leave, he can leave and he will get a B. So I happily left. I was the only one to leave. For the rest who stayed he gave all of them A for believing in themselves.</RelCBody>

Hello everybody,

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
I was wondering where can I buy sarees (spelling??) in Doha (the traditionnal indian ones, 100% silk with hand made embrodery: e.g. the one used for weeding)

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
I did a search on google but couldn't find anything!

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
I really appreciate your help

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Thanks

			<RelCBody>i actually had a treatment at the six senses spa, and it was fantastic!  i would definitely recommend it. 


but of course, it would depend on what you value more...the price or the value.  what the spa in ritz offer is different from four seasons and chakra. 


from what i know, the spa in ritz is managed by six senses, and the outlook is traditional, but still luxurious.  six senses's products are really good, and their service is also great.

if you have time (and money), definitely try all of them...its best to find one that suits you</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I bought a grand vitara last year XL7 it was for a good price. but i really regretted, the service of teyseer is the worst I've ever experienced: lousy, unhelpful service staff with disgusting facilities. I took me two visits to the service center before i give up and started taking it to other oil changing shops .


besides, the car has many manufacturing defects (according to a friend he is still facing them in his new model): CD player, brake system...


At the time when I bought it it was the only car with 7 seaters with a very reasonable price (67000), but finally It would have been better for me if i bought a pajero or a pathfinder.

On the top of all that the resale value of the suzuki is not so encouraging.

			<RelCBody>It depends on the brand. As a general rule most UK brands  (such as BHS, Next, M&amp;amp;S, H&amp;amp;M) are priced at an exchange rate of QR7 to ?1. As the current rate is closer to QR5 to ?1 clothes will be cheaper in the UK. On top of this retailers are discounting heavily in the UK because of the recession.


If you look at some French or Spanish brands (Zara) they are cheaper in Doha.

			<RelCBody>Hi everyone, a real case of emergency.

I joined a company in Qatar 7 months back. I really wish to quit my job as I am getting better job offers in other firms. My contract is for 2 yrs. So it is evident that they will not give me NOC and i will be banned for 2 yrs. My husband is working here in Qatar. But his salary is too low to apply for a family resident visa. I wish to know if I resign my job and once the company cancels my RP, can I come back to Qatar in family visit visa and extend it for another 5 months. So we hope by the time, we can make any arrangements for family resident visa.

Please your reply is really valuable. </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>There is no salary specification for visit visa, what matter most is NOC from your company and the profession on your RP must not be labour. Go to immigration or submit the following through your company PRO to immigration.
NOC letter from your sponsor.
Salary Pay Slip
RP( The profession must not be labour)
your wife and daughter passport
Marriage certificate( attested by your embassy)
You pay 200riya with this document.(you pay this with your card when you want submit)
The visa will be one month visit visa but it can be extended to 6months with payment of 200riya every month provided your wife and child pass the medical test within the first month.
Note- TO CHANGE YOUR FAMILY VISIT VISA TO FAMILY RESIDENCE VISA YOU MUST HAVE A SALARY OF 10,000 RIYA.
best of luck.

I would like to share with you my impressions from the Fuwairit Beach, around 80km north from Doha, I visited 2 weeks ago. Even though the water was too cold for swimming, the place is amazing. I can't wait to go there in summer... well.. let's say before the summer heat :-)

Let's use this opportunity and suggest some nice beaches to go to.


What is your favorite place?

Peace!

			<RelCBody>Thanks sounds like there is a few like me out there so I guess next stop is to pioneer a group lets see how it goes. Sponsored by my wife so not difficult. I have left behind a hand made furniture company which once my son is at school I will look to produce here as it does seem we could do with some good furniture here. Many thanks to all your replies and yes I am a lucky man for being in this position and am certainly looking forward to it, I will post a new thread shortly to try and set up a dads group.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>My husband is a stay at home dad too. I tried to get with QL to create a group for stay at home dads. Didnt happen.

The same as the stay at home mom's, dad's seem some life outside of watching the kids or even just staying with the kids.

PM me and I'll send you my hubby's #. I'm sure he'd be very happy to get together and chat.

One thing I can say is kudos to the dad's, you guys do soooo much to take care of our families and sometimes we mom's get lost in our own worlds to realize it. 

Welcome to Qatar and send me a message and I'll get you his contact --- email/phone, whatever</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>There is a sleep clinic at the Hamad.


It was there that I discovered that I had sleep apoenea, and they have treated that now.  Its abslutely amazing to sleep all night every night, {except when I forget and have caffeine, or a fizzy drink by mistake) - first time in over 40 years!
   

Go to the second floor (the one above ground floor)in the OutPatient Dept and ask at room 215 for the sleep clinic.   They will direct you as to what you have to do to be assessed.

You will need a Hamad Health Card (100 QR) for this.

			<RelCBody>I had to stay overnight at the Hamad Hosp, while a couple monitored me all night from another room.   I was wired up all over the place, which for me wasn't too comfortable, and then left to 'sleep'... which I did very little of anyway as I didn't like the 'wiring'.  

I was also diagnosed by the Maxillo Facial Surgeon, who checked the size of my jaw, tongue etc etc, and noted that this was one of the causes of my apnoea.   I didn't do the 'sleeping pills run' as I had an operation instead to alter my jaw and remove a bit of my tongue (sounds gross, but wasn't really that bad).
But this is definitely the route to take, as pills may not be the answer for you... maybe there is something else wrong that can be corrected.
Hope you get 'relief' soon...I know what you're going thru!

			<RelCBody>Dear Charlene, i have the same problem, for about 10 years. I saw a doctor here in Hamad Outpatients, his name is Abdoul Moneim, he is a very good psichiatrist, and he prescibed me the same sleeping pills i use to take in my country, that's Zolpidem (or Stillnox), its relly good, but he will not give you more than 14 tablets.
When i canot get this medicine, i use to take Tryptozol 25 mg, but only half tablet, you can find it in any farmacy without prescription.
I wish you good luck and sleep well..</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Hi Julia,

Thanks for your reply. It is so good to hear that there is help out there! I guess I should of just went and asked a Dr. here instead of assuming that it would be like it was in  Kuwait and couldn't get anything stronger then a Advil!

Hope you are getting good rest now...


bajesus,

I'm afraid Panaodol night would never do the trick for me. As for the luttuce juice, well, I would rather stay awake! lol. Thanks though!

e46m3

I can relate for sure. Nothing worse then trying to sleep and then just laying there tossing and turning. I've learned to just get up and stay up untill I feel like I'm going to drop, lol. A lot of nights I get out of bed and stay up the whole night without any sleep! Go to bed anywhere from 5:00 to 8:00 A.M and still only get a few hours sleep...Person can't function well to say to least.


I've been up for two hours this morning and it is now only 6:00! And it is moving day.....

Hope to hear you are getting some much needed rest!

Thanks everyone,

I've learned to just get up and stay up untill I feel like I'm going to drop; lol. A lot of nights I get out of bed and stay up the whole night without any sleep! Go to bed anywhere from 5:00 to 8:00 A.M and still only get a few hours sleep...Person can't function well to say to least. I've been up for two hours this morning and it is now only 6:00! And it is moving day..... Hope to hear you are getting some much needed rest! Thanks everyone; Charlene</RelCClean>

			<RelCBody>Have you made sure that you're cutting out all caffeine before sleeping?   It takes 6 hours to flush out caffeine from the body, which is found in not only the obvious, like tea and coffee, but also in fizzy drinks like coke, seven-up etc, tonic water (very, very bad!!), soda water, beer, and sparkling wines and sparkling mineral water.  Anything with bubbles can activate the brain instead of allowing it to sleep.  Also, chocolate is a sleep depriver too.

If you're taking any of the above within six hours of going to bed, then you'll have sleep problems if you react to them.   Most folk don't think about the chocolate biscuit with a cuppa, late on in the day, but that's saying goodbye to sleep! regardless of what stress you are or aren't under.

I stayed awake for four days once, when I was drinking just tonic water (I don't have a sweet tooth).   A friend told me of his similar situation when he'd had a tonic water in a 'mixer' drink.  He also took four days to figure out what was wrong...and easily diagonosed my problem then.  Dropping the caffeine made major difference to the kind of sleep I had too... I felt refreshed, instead of just 'asleep'.   So maybe you need to look at your diet as well.

			<RelCBody>these sites definitely reflect the lack of understanding of recruitment in people who designed them

what they do is to match you on very limited criteria such as the last industry you worked in. What I mean is: if for example you've worked in Oil &amp;amp; Gas for years, but your last job (even just 6 momths) was in pharmaceuticals, then they will match you with pharmaceuticals!


Working in HR I look on CVs posted on Gulf Talent only in desperate times and to be honest never employed anyone through these web sites.


So, if you're looking for a job, I would suggest uploading your CV on Gult Talent or Bayt just in case you get lucky, but spend most of your efforts applying directly through companies' web sites and going in to the companies to hand in your CV. Good luck!

			<RelCBody>I use them a lot for a variety of uses as I live in Dukhan.
5 years ago if you called and asked for a taxi tomorrow they would say that nothing was available until 3am two weeks on Tuesday.
Now they say yes no problem, call back to confirm the details, call the day before to remind me and call when he is on the way.
I have never had a problem with the drivers except sometimes they are clearly under a lot of pressure and stressed. Maybe people could show some compassion for the drivers who live under difficult conditions so you get a cheap service.

By the way I find the blatant racism on this website offensive.  Most forums would not allow it.  It is outrageous to define people by their nationality and such serious allegations, if not able to prove are simply slanderous.</RelCBody>

Folks,
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The term &amp;amp;quot;Oil Money&amp;amp;quot; and Petro-Dollars is mis-used.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
It somehow gives the impression that the money is black or dirty.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Oil is a resource.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
And it is OIL and its related development which has given us folks in the Gulf so many jobs.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
So will the Western Media please stop refrerring to it like it is some kind of dirty money ?
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
When Booth killed Lincoln, he shouted &amp;amp;quot; Woe to the Traitors&amp;amp;quot;, similar to what Brutus said when he killed Caesar.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The Western media has an inherent bias, which is very subtle.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Israeli forces are called: IDF ( Israeli Defense Forces)
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Whereas, a Palestinian child ?throwing a rock at?an Israeli tank passing through his family orchard is a &amp;amp;quot;Future terrorist&amp;amp;quot;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
I dont support either the soldier or the rock-thrower.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
However, I believe in calling a spade a spade.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
That's why a magazine like &amp;amp;quot;The Economist&amp;amp;quot; is respectable and a media source like &amp;amp;quot;Fox News&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;CNN&amp;amp;quot; is a farce to promote the bias inherent in their owners.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The Internet, howvere, has changed all that by breaking the monopoly of content generation and content dissipation.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
:-)

			<RelCBody>Right. Thanks for that lesson.

I just read an interesting article and thought I'd share it, but I wont bother again if people are just going to pick it apart rather than appreciate someone taking an interest in what's going on here.

Everyone is entitled to comment on anything posted on this forum, but I don't like to post material that provokes a negative reaction. I thought I was pretty safe with this one, but obviously I was wrong.

Tallg, I have had remarks like 'what have you cooked'??or stick to poetry, which were completely irrelavant to the topic so don't be disappointed. It is a healthy article for many.

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
I wanted to add few excerpts from Dr. Tidu Maini, who is a adviser to 'Sheikha Mouza'. He says 'developing countries will fail if they do not invest in education and research and convert their economies into knowledge based ones'.

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
So there is a lot of interest being generated into research and knowledge, particularly in energy, environment and healthcare.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

islamonline might legalize their use but they still won't let them into Qatar.  Go figure.
Just like liquor, upu can't bring it in but you can drink gallons of it once you've arrived.  Talk about double standards.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>the liquor ban i can understand. QDC will never allow anything or anyone to pose a threat to the revenues of their monopoly.


the sex toys i'm a little puzzled about. if muslim scholars say they're alright..why are they still banned? And I can't imagine the Qatari government would entertain the thought of allowing a QDC-type monopoly to run sex shops around the country (imagine having to acquire a license for these shops. based on your marital status not your annual income of course :p)</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>There is land route via Saudi Arabia.
You have to cross Qatar- Saudi border, then Saudi-UAE border.  Both borders u will have to spend atleast one hour for clearance.  Then you have to pay road insurance for both the countries(ie. Saudi and UAE).  The road in between qatar- saudi border and saudi-UAE border is not that good.  Extra care is required.  UAE border post, you may have to scan your eye for entry visa purposes that can take sometime.  Altogether you have to spend 6 to 7 hours.....

			<RelCBody>Both offers are very good, but looking at the cities and living conditions i would have preferred Abudhabi over Qatar reasons are.

1. Abudhabhi is in UAE which is very big compared to Qatar and u can move to Sharjah, Dubai, ajman, fujairah and manymore places without visa, entertainment and social life is good in Abudhabhi,

2. Living standards are good in Aubdhabhi,


3. Rentwise both cities offer you houses at same prices.

4. Traffic congesetion is more in Doha compared to Abudhabhi,

So i would have preferred Abudhabhi</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>So far anyone I've met that is with Al Jazeera international seems very content.  They have generally good packages (or at least from what I hear) and comfortable accomodations.  The staff is diverse with a large number of employees from the UK.  I think it should be a good experience.  But, really there are no 'suprises' , but you will really have to come and experience it for yourself.  You may love it and someone else may hate it and vise versa.</RelCBody>

			<RelQBody>Hello,
My employer got me a business visa and not a working visa. They said that it's hard to get a work visa so they will just fix my work visa when I get there. Does this really happen? They also said they'll book me a return ticket, but I failed to ask why.

They said that it's hard to get a work visa so they will just fix my work visa when I get there. Does this really happen? They also said they'll book me a return ticket; but I failed to ask why. I worry that they could just throw me elsewhere when they become unhappy with my work performance...Hoping someone could enlighten me on this; thanks.</RelQClean>

			<RelCBody>It takes time to apply for a work visa. Another thing it will take also some time to process your papers there in P.I. They booked you a return ticket because you will not be allowed by P.I. immigration to board with only one way ticket. You're on a business visa and you need to come back to where you came from. That is only for formality sake so you can passed thru Immigration. Better have your medical check up there before coming here. Like chest x-ray and blood stool urine lab test. If you fail here you will be sent back.</RelCBody>

&amp;quot;... they could just throw me elsewhere when they become unhappy with my work performance...&amp;quot;

When you have your work visa later, you'll need an exit permit from your sponsor / employer every time you go out at the airport, so it is suggested that you do keep them happy with your work performance ... of course, you will, I'm just saying.

			<RelCBody>this is a very normal thing.. once you got here your business visa should be converted to working visa. The problem arises in the Immigration in Philippines. They will ask lots of questions and squeeze in some out of nowhere questions.. Just be prepared and act one that knows the Law.If you fail to pass thru the immigration, they will definitely get the last penny you have in you pocket. I felt bad to some people who are a victim of this. There was already a report in yahoo maktob stating how cruel the immigration officers in asking for some money for the individual to get out of the country! Aren't they supposed to let that person pass peacefully? I hate to say this but , my tax when I was still working in Manila,paid them well enough... so they should serve us well and with respect instead of bullying us for the sake of money! :D Just my 2 cents here!</RelCBody>

1)&amp;lt;u&amp;gt; You know why does this issue exist? &amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;
There is a heavy abuse of the Business visa concept. Filipinos find their ways to buy this type of visa for the purpose of coming to Qatar and searching a job here. Which is illegal. Your immigration fellows only use your own criminal approach to this matter. One part of the mafia is buying the illegal visas. Another part of the mafia wants to have their fat piece out of it. Simple. YOUR own criminal action leads to your immigration officers? criminal actions. YOU ALL are involved in this vicious circle, as one criminal group. STOP buying the illegal visas,  and this will cut the ground from under the feets of your fellow-immigration officers, and they will stop demanding thier share.
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Sunny &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;, as an exception, it does not apply to you. Unlike others, you got your business visa legally, issued by your hiring Company. Other hundreds and hundreds of your fellow filipinos abuse this law. And then they complain that other law abusers want to get their share. It's like one thief is demanding from another thief to share the stolen goods, and when the second thief refuses to do so, the first thief goes to the police and complains against him. Silly!
2) &amp;lt;u&amp;gt; You know who to be blamed? &amp;lt;/u&amp;gt; That one easy and short: YOURSELF!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Hi Alex, 


You'll find the gay scene here a little odd.  It's not acceptable and actually illegal to be gay here.  If you are caught you will possibly be lashed and deported.  That being said there are many MANY MANY gay men here.  There is quite a thriving underground gay scene.  No specific bars, but if you hang out at the Pearl, Admirals or Cloud Nyn, you defintely run into a few.  


Now, from what I understand there is a lot of &amp;quot;boy-toy&amp;quot; &amp;quot;sugar-daddy&amp;quot; action here.  The Arab men aren't really comfortable with having a relationship, so they tend to stick to just sex.  If you want lots of stuff like cars and apartments, there the guys you go too.  If you want a relationship, unfortunatly, you might be out of luck.  There are some really great gay guys here, and most of them want relationships, but they say it's just really hard to maintain one here (not surprising because heterosexual relationships are hard to maintain here too).  It's just the lifestyle I guess.


You're probably going to get a lot of disgusted responses to your post, so feel free to PM with any more questions regarding the scene. :)

But this all is easier said and written than done!. So my friend dont think to accept the offer with this salary! If your company is providing with free accomodation, food and travel then may be you could save upto 1000 Riyals!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Matt, I've been here pretty much since 2008, and overall the place has improved since then. Certain laws and regulations change, and it can be a frustrating place, but on the whole you can live a very nice life here. I moved from London, and adjusted pretty easily. Come with an open mind and you'll be fine. There are plenty of people in the same position and you'll meet other expats easily.

What I will say, is you have to build your life here and it can be an easy place to hate if you don't make the effort....especially for the wife. Hopefully she's outgoing, and it shouldn't be a problem to meet people.
Choosing where to live is a big part! Maersk is in West Bay so possibly get an amazing apartment here close to all the bars and restaurants and City Center for shopping. Better for the wife if she can walk to places....Get somewhere short term in West Bay to start and give yourself a chance to learn about Doha and where you want to be permanently located. Longer message than planned!! Nice pad in West Bay will run from 18,000QR (Tower 44) - 27,000 (4 Seasons)...you can go cheaper of course, depends on your preference. Hope that all helps!</RelCBody>

How do workers from blighty generally get paid into UK or Qatar banks? Who are the best internet and satalite providers? Whats the weather like!!! lol</RelQClean>

			<RelCBody>depend who you working for. I am sure every company have their own way doing things.


For us ... we were given a company housing for the first 3 months , then they give you allowance to look somewhere else.

We receive our furniture allowance as soon as my husband pass his probation period.


The first 2 weeks husband get a car and a driver to go to work, after that we rent a car till we received our resident permit and able to buy a car.


Internet so far only 1 provider : Qtel.So take it or leave it... you dont have a choice.

The pay tranferred to our local bank, then every few months we send the money to the UK.


Anyway ... welcome to QL, do use the 'search' button on the top right to search any question you have in mind. Anything you want to ask in perticular just post away :-)

The weather at the moment when you go outdoor just like you go inside the sauna room ...

			<RelCBody>welcome to qatar!
usualy you have to start your work next day after arrival, max within 3 days, but it depends on your company... some give you 1 week or even more...
usually furniture allowance is given after the probation perod, i.e. 3 months.
You can have your car only after you get your RP which will take at least 1 month..
so shortly, be prepared for a bit uncomfortable life first couple of months till you settle down, start getting used to your new life, sort out your new friends issue and so on..
but again, it might be various depends on the company and your personal ability to adapt a new environment..
good luck and have fun in Doha!!

Proceedure may change on companies as said before. Just ask HR. They are normally willing to answer most questions. Negotiate a few days if U need to as I have to settle in.

Good luck

			<RelCBody>Totally depends on your budget!

Salwa Road (You can find some luxury designer brands and bathroom/kitchen fittings.)
Home Center in City Center, Centerpoint/Al Asmakh Mall, and Musheireb.
Homes R Us in Hyatt Plaza.
Bo Concept in City Center.
Souq Al Haraj in Najma area.
ID Design in The Mall.
Origins (www . originssofas . com)

I usually end up buying from Home Center because it's relatively inexpensive, and at times I take things apart and customize them.

Some of the couches in ID Design are very cute, colorful, modern and at a decent price if you are looking for something nicer than Home Center.

But Doha still lacks a great basics store for furniture. That's why everyone is waiting on Ikea.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>try the entire line of furniture shops from midmac r/a to decoration r/a.oops are they the same r/a?

the ONE is simply hyped up and expensive and so is ID Design.

there is one at the airport road leading to parachute r/a called Nabina Furnitures...got to park on the main road due to road works.....oh and there is a sale going on over there.

american home furnitures next to jarir book store
tivoli furnitures at the al sadd signal....if you come from alsadd signal towards the signals that will take you to centrepoint(alasmakh mall on the right)....you go straight....its somewhere there. if you go to yugoslavian furnitures that is opposite darwish trading at the midmac signals...they will tell you where tivoli is.

mind you...some of these places is a little pricy but they have good stuff. something that you may not necessarily find in homecentre.

then again if you want second hand or make your own furniture by design you can go to the najma area.....ask anyone there for directions,i may confuse you.....once there bargain and get the best price for whatever you want.

happy heart
drive safe because someone is waiting for you at home</RelCBody>

The furniture here sucks! The few stores with modern lines like ID Design and The One are really overpriced, like Colt said.

			<RelCBody>That's the problem with furniture in Doha.  Look at Bombay Company in the Mall and their US website and compare the prices.  We wanted a bed that cost 17,000 riyals in their shop here and on the US website $1000, exact same bed.  The silly (Lebanese) manager at the Mall shop said no discount, only for repeat customers!  They wanted to maintain exclusivity.  I think he meant the exclusivity of fleecing gullible customers or the exclusion of reason.  One of the two.
Even if I were to ship it from the US it would be cheaper buying it from the website.</RelCBody>

The choice of material suited us as well (York textiles) and best of all the price was between Qr800- Qr850 (depending upon the window size). Good craftmanship, too. All the best.</RelCBody>

All these shops are located on Salwa road. King Koil &amp;amp; matnaflex are nearly next to each other on the rightside coming from Midmac. Springwall is further down on the otherside (if I remeber ell near DHL or could be the next block further coming back)

Without sounding biased, you will ALWAYS get great deals and when my father says you get a guarantee, you get a guarantee 100% no questions asked.

King Koil is one of the best mattresses around. Tell you what though, say that Khalifa Saleh recommended you (Saleh Haroon's son) and you might even get an extra discount! ^_^

As for Ikea, I have bought two mattresses from them in the past, I've had them go wonky or unshaped within 6 months and Ikea refused to even talk to me.

I think it varies too when it comes to different property companies providing just what sort of furnitures,  so it's important to find out from each of them if you do wanna go for a semi furnished one :)</RelCBody>

I was in Delft (the netherlands) in the ikea recently and that is the main office for Ikea worldwide.
A manager there told me that there will be some kind of distribution center set up in Doha. He thought it would include a small showroom as well. He did think it would not be for another two years though!!

			<RelCBody>Ask any pathan (Pakistani nationals identified by their unique national dress) that you come across. Chances are good he himself might be an owner of a pickup. If not he would definitely arrange one for you. Or if you could drive down to Alfardan bus stand, you can find such big pickups parked in line with pathans sitting in the driving seats. The rate will obviously depend on from where you have to pickup your furniture and where to drop, but it should be within or around QR100. Bargaining will possibly bring down what you end up paying.

			<RelCBody>Most decent towers will have a pool as well as possibly a tennis court.  Or you could join one of the nearby hotel clubs.    The villa compound life is more suited towards families.  Think suburbia vs. city life.    It can easily take 45 minutes to get from Villagio to West Bay.   Traffic is the #1 headache in Doha.</RelCBody>

hi there! don't expect too much.? your package includes basic, tranport allow HRA etc depending on what grade are you and 10% increment of basic salary every year depending on your boss' evaluations. Those allowances which you asked as far as I know are not? provided except OT during holidays no bonuses no incentives. You could only enjoy the unlimited ID90 SL booking hmmm? and very annoying in the airport. One confirmed annual ticket for your wife and yourself.

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;nbsp;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Send me PM? I will give you more details.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

just for everyone's info. the said annual ticket on each qatar airways staff is governed by their staff handbook. and it is always &amp;amp;quot;Subject to Load&amp;amp;quot; and not &amp;amp;quot;Confirmed&amp;amp;quot; so even you are on your annual leave you have to always wait at the staff check-in counter if there will be seats available.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

			<RelCBody>I accept your source that there has been a fire there. At some point.

			<RelCClean>I accept your source that there has been a fire there. At some point. But when did it happen and was it the original cause of the sudden closure? The shop doors were fine; clean and there were no signs of smoke (at least near the entrance) and some lights inside were still working when I went there on about 4th April. Couple of days after it shut. I'll have a look next time I pass that way.</RelCClean>

			<RelCBody>i agree with tallg and gypsy, even though you have a liqour permit you need to be discrete when transporting booze to your place, if you're a little bit observant there is a notice at QDC stating that transporting ligouqrs, specifically on those cartons, should be placed inside the trunk of their car, and should not be exposed.

			<RelCBody>It is Ok, But definately not worth the Price there are asking for know.We know someone in Fasialiya who got in there last year and is paying 10K but now they want 16k plus. Please look around there are good compound at reasonable price. Most of the compound in Al Waab are owned or managed by Al Asmakh who are not the best to deal with as they have a big share of the market and are pricing the properties too much.

The bubble will burst sooner rather than later.........</RelCBody>

It also has a shop very handy. And i think they have started doing shisha and coffee in the clubhouse. Plus loads of nice people inc many of my collegues, your lucky to get it.

			<RelCBody>My criteria in tipping the taxi driver are:

1- Don't ask me no questions about me or don't tell me where you from.
I got my Confession Booth for those moments.

2- Don't drive like you are driving Miss Daisy or some Indianapolis 500 racing stock car in the roads. Better use those turn signals and do your yielding. I have enough of the local population egocentric driving habits.

3- Don't be smelling like Garlic or some lost flowering fragrance, it just gives me a headache.  I Don't want memories of the local malls.

4- Better have the meter on and pronounce those numbers properly.

5- and learn to difference between, drive Straight ahead, turn left and turn right.

daiwai ... if you spent QR 50, 10 percents would be only QR 5. But when you eat in the hotel ... you will easily spent QR 600 to QR 700 , on top of that they will charge you another 17 percents ... and you still have to leave 10 percents for the tip?

I think it's very rare for the service charge included in the bill to go to the waiters. I don't even know if 'service' actual means the waiter service.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Best to ask the waiter if they get it or not. If they don't then leave a tip if you think they deserve it, for the amount you think they deserve. I hate the American culture of always tipping. A normal tip should reward normal service, with a bigger tip rewarding service above your expectations. But if the service is poor (as it so often is here) then they haven't earnt a tip in my opinion.

			<RelCBody>Please note that for every 10 person you will serve on the bar there are only 2 possible person that can give you a tip personally. Here in Qatar tips are not usually considered unless by the white peoples. But you need also to consider the company policy on tipping, for there are some which is centralized. But if you're expecting to received 100 riyals tip per day, I can say there's a big possibilities that you might not get it, besides, for sure you're not just the only one who's working there as a waiter.</RelCBody>

My flight has booked by the company that I will be working for.
So hopefully I just have to turn up.
(Famous last words!)
I will finally be arriving in Doha on Saturday morning.

What about tipping in Doha??
Is it usual practice to tip taxi drivers in Doha?

What about tipping in general, who to tip and how much?
This is my first time in Doha and the Middle East so don't want to make any mistakes or offend/upset people.

Thanks again for any advice.

			<RelCBody>Welcome to doha, may your stay yield fruitfulness and prospects in your career. I believe your company men will arrive at the airport to pick you up.

call Taxis are identified as &amp;quot;KARWA&amp;quot; in here. There's no regular practice in tipping for taxis in doha Qr.2+ will do, however if you dont prefer there's no harm.

People who deserve tips

1. Runners(who serve you parcels while you are on car) for small

   restaurants.
2. Petrol fillers.
3. Private car cleaners
4. The lists are endless, you will identify once you arrive in here...
5. road side guys selling news papers on hot weather.

best of luck.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>You can most certainly use your cash card, providing it's hooked up to a world ATM network (Cirrus, etc.) or has a credit card symbol.  I was not charged a fee by QNB (Qatar National Bank); only by my home bank (which I fully expected). 


As for an ATM in arrivals, unfortunately, I've not seen one.  I may have missed it, though, as I've been wisked through by the greeting service both times. 


If you are going to a hotel first, you can either use an ATM or take cash and exchange it.  I did this (exchanged cash) the first time at the Intercon(tinental) without difficulty.  Just ask when you check in. 


If you are going to your accommodation, malls and shops are open late now with it being Ramandan (1 am or so).  Ask your driver for advice.  City Center Doha (the big mall), which I live across from, is like this.  10 minutes and the money problem is solved.   


Established shops will take a credit card should you need to make a purchase before you can get to the ATM.  However, Doha is pretty wired.  You can find an ATM.  Fee or no fee, who cares the first time--at least you've got money to operate on.      </RelCBody>
			<RelCClean>You can most certainly use your cash card; providing it's hooked up to a world ATM network (Cirrus; etc.) or has a credit card symbol. I was not charged a fee by QNB (Qatar National Bank); only by my home bank (which I fully expected). As for an ATM in arrivals; unfortunately; I've not seen one.

			<RelCBody>Thanks for your comments and advice.

The company have arranged limo to collect me and my son from the airport and to take us to the hotel.  I was not sure if I would need to tip the driver or not.

I think that I will just use my card to withdraw cash from my UK bank account when I first get to Doha so that I have some cash to use for small purchases and I will pay for larger purchases with my card.

Thanks again for your help.

			<RelCBody>Mmm... well, I can see your point there.  However, as you're just arriving in the country, no one is expecting you to have riyals ready to distribute.  Or I'd hope not. 


Besides, the ATM spits out bigger bills than you'd tip to a driver (as in every country, UK included).  So then you'd have the trouble of having to get one broken down.

If you're going to the hotel, and you really want to tip the driver, just ask him to wait for a second.  Run in, tell them what you want to do, and change a bill.  Or borrow 10 riyals from the bellhop, tell them you're changing money in just a second, and then give it back after you've changed money.  


Truthfully, though, I wouldn't sweat it too much.  You'll have other things to occupy yourself with. 


Which hotel?  The Intercon is quite nice.  The breakfast buffet is gigantic.  Literally 15 kinds of bread (at least).  Fresh fruit juices.  A whole long table filled with fruit and cheeses.    </RelCBody>

			<RelQBody>Is Qatar out of Coins?

I have noticed that many businesses here in Qatar instead of giving the proper change back on a purchase, they try to give a candy or some gum. And the prices are always conveniently priced at a little over .50. The clerk always says sorry Sr. We have no change or the boss tells us to give the gum.  It?s a great way for them to earn extra. When they offer me the gum I tell them I will use my ATM card

			<RelCBody>Here is the thing; the shopkeepers are brainless idiots!
Why?

Take my local shop for example.
There are no price tags on anything. You have to ask them 'how much is this'. I don't know the prices of anything in there.

So when you go to pay, WHY tell you 11.50, with gum, just say 12 bloody riyals! How the hell am I going to know?!! That way I won't get annoyed at thinking I am losing money.

They could do this without causing half the arguments.
Do I want to pay more for my shopping? No.
But I have never been into a shop and said '20 riyals? I am SURE my bill is 19.50'.

They are so stupid.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>One of the best customer services I have experienced in Doha is at the Commercial Bank.
They never neglect your emails when you complain, they try to understand every detail of your problem and give you options to solve it, and they keep following up until you are satisfied.

I have a similar pleasant experience with the manager of the service center of United Cars. He makes sure to read your emails and sends instant instructions to his employees to fix the problems.

Unfortunately there are companies who don't bother if their customers are happy or not. They come from a background of: &amp;quot;take it or leave it...you don't have any other option&amp;quot;
My brother experienced this lately with QGRABS. They sell some cheap quality offers and they don't bother to even apologize, not to mention a compensation.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody> No need wasting your money for specific GPS unit, all you need is just a mobile phone with GPS capability.

 Or just used google maps if you don't want get headache of renewal the maps.

 Im using GPS only to know where my position is and then figure out the fastest route because you know how often re-routing happened here in Doha.

the one I bought was wireless and I got from Modern Home (east 51 now). You can find it also in carrefour and technical center. but I don't know if they are region free.

the games range from around a 100 to 300. and they play DVDs but I didn't try the copied DVDs

as for the prices u may find special offers in Carrefour, but I go to Technical Care Center for a big range of games and hardware

As ive said, Amoud, its probably under service warranty of 1 or 2 years not so sure with 2 years. so it will be free for now.

Im sure carrefour will just bring it to Consolidated for SErvice afterwards and it might take a longer time than bringing it directly to Consolidated.</RelCBody>

Good thing about Nokia is, that even if you dont have the receipt they register the serial number and have it on the system so your warranty is still valid even if you lost the receipt.  ___________________________________________________

If he is having a no entry stamp to Dubai then he will not be able to get visa to any of the GCC countries.

Hi everyone,

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;nbsp;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
I'm quite partial to a bit of shisha (bought my own), but I can only seem to find a few flavours - apple/2-apple, mint, cherry, melon &amp;amp;amp; grape.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;nbsp;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Can anyone suggest somewhere that sells a greater range than the ones above?
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The development came after Apple warned earlier that the update would render ?permanently inoperable? devices that had been unlocked by owners who wanted to choose which mobile network to use. ? DPA

			<RelCBody>The accommodation is perhaps a couple of kilometers from the center of old Doha, probably four kilometers from West Bay. I have heard that they don't like to employ Indians but I don't know for sure. They move extremely slowly whenever I have any dealings with them. Don't respond to emails, never answer a direct question, and don't return calls. They don't permit staff to access Internet resources regardless of need for job. I would imagine the work is secure because they are definitiely not a popular employer. Getting &amp;quot;looked after&amp;quot; is relative.

			<RelCBody>Well, for one thing, you don't just move to Qatar.  You have to have a residence visa, which means you have to be sponsored, usually by a family member or an employer.  They're not going to let your BF sponsor you.

Can you live together?  If you don't mind living illegally, sure, you can live together.  Whether this in fact turns into a problem will depend on a whole lot of factors, but you should be aware that it CAN turn into the sort of problem that spells p-r-i-s-o-n and d-e-p-o-r-t-a-t-i-o-n. 


You can drink, lots of people do (I do), but you will be in a Muslim country under Sharia law.  You would be well advised to be very discreet.

Lastly, Qatar would not be my first choice if having &amp;quot;a good time&amp;quot; were all that important to me.  I think of it more as a place that one navigates as best one can.  It's not all that bad a place to live, but you do have to be somewhat resourceful.

Qatar is amongst the more liberal of Gulf countries I believe, which isn't saying enough because the Gulf does not even compare to the liberality of the fertile crescent Arab countries like Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.


Though I personally don't drink, the vast majority of people I know do, and they do not seem to have a problem accessing it (which makes for some interesting weekends I can assure you!)


Where in the US do you live? And what are your qualifications? Have you considered looking for a job here?


If you are thinking about getting married to the guy, I believe he can sponsor you, contact the American Embassy for more info (though i never found them to be particularly resourceful lol). Their number is (974) 4884101.


Good luck!

			<RelCBody>Yes, you can live together -


You'll need to be discreet, i.e. do not tell your muslim friends and acquaintances about it.

Yes, you can go out for drinks -


No need to be discreet here as long as you consume in bars and night clubs (which are almost always in hotels) and your home. During Ramadan you can only drink up at home and it's common practice to stock up on booze before this period.

Also, never ever get into trouble with the cops when drunk. Drink driving is definitely not advisable.

But, I agree fully with &amp;quot;OOO&amp;quot;. Come in on a holiday and see for yourself before you decide.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I dont think there is any problem with the issues you have raised. I have a few western friends who have been living together for quite a while now. Although they met each other after coming here and were on seperate sponsorships but ended up living together.

As far as drinking is concerned. I do not drink myself (except water, juice &amp;amp; milk :), people say that they have absolutely no problem accessing alcohol.

Hope this helps.</RelCBody>

&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;rockets being fired WHERE? On Zionist settlers who were provided with Palestinean homes by their armies after having ripped off these homes from the original Palestineans? I think these invaders/settlers should go back to the countries they came from.

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Yes! On 1 side there are the women &amp;amp;amp; children of the original owners of the land who were living peacefully like every nation on earth, and on the other side there are the women &amp;amp;amp; children who left their countries around the world, came to invade a country which don't belong to them, started killing the families of the original owners, and stole their homes.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Now you can use your brain to judge!

I do not support in any way the treatment of the Palestinians by the Israelis and the tragic loss of life of innocents is unforgiveable.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
What I do not understand though is why certain Palestinian factions continue to fire home made rockets into Israel. What good does it do? It takes away sympathy from the Palestinian cause and it causes innocent deaths on the Israeli side of the border. Worse of all, everyone knows that the Israelis retaliate with much greater force and cause many more innocent palestinian deaths.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Stop giving Israel an excuse to kill. Use brain power not gun powder. Look to the examples of Ghandi and Mandela to make change and get the Isrealis to return to 1967 borders. These stupid rockets just cause more unecessary deaths.??

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Actually the Israelis shouldn't be there! They should leave the lands/homes to their arab owners and go back to the countries they came from. Only then there will be peace in the middle east.

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Actually the Israelis shouldn't be there! They should leave the lands/homes to their arab owners and go back to the countries they came from. Only then there will be peace in the middle east. There can never be peace in USA for example, if the Red Indians took the state of Arizona &amp;amp;amp; declared it as a free republic. The Americans will be having a continuous war with them until one destroys the other. The American government (and people) will &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEVER&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; accept to have peace talks with the &amp;amp;quot;Red Indian Republic of Arizona&amp;amp;quot;.

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Stop giving Israel an excuse to kill&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
They will ALWAYS kill....with or without an excuse

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
This reminds me of the American invasion of Iraq. The Americans were bound to attack Iraq whether Saddam pulled out of Kuwait or not, had weapos of mass destruction or not, provided democracy to his people or not,?resigned or not......(I remember they said that they are coming to the area &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ONLY&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to liberate Kuwait....look what happened since then)&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

			<RelCBody>Hey !

Welcome to Qatar. Every job market has its fair share of positives and negatives. Getting a job in qatar is quite tough depending on the channel you use to source for jobs. Also depends on your expectations. There is vast majority of job seekers in Qatar who consider themselves qualified in many ways but often find out that the expectations of the employer are much higher. Also, you should try to be more specific. For eg: in the question you placed, you could have easily mentioned what kind of position you are looking out for to let everyone know in one go. But you chose not to. In addition to this, most ministries and govt organizations are implementing qatarization policies. So you will find a decrease in very 'high paying' jobs for expatriates. The private firm would not probably pay you as much. To avoid dissapointment you could try to filter the interviews coming to you. Ask before-hand what to expect in the interviews. The sources of recruitment / agencies are easily accessible on the net. A person who could post this question on QL can easily google it out. Go for it !

Finally, it all comes down to the numbers and proper networking. Keep applying - god willing, all will turn out well.

Good luck !</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>You don't have to be defensive. I pointed out a defect that you can work on to get better chances. It is not about social network Vs Email to your boss. You can get a slight chance for a job offer through qatarliving. Would you rather hire someone that can't write correct English if you can hire someone that can?

Also, why would you even mention what I have on another thread? You don't even know the full story? Again you contradict the true meaning of professionalism. My other thread is due to people who take money and give you a fake receipt and do not deliver. How is this my fault?



Good luck to you,

based on my poor judgement, you might need a lot of it.

i had a friend who worked in doha for 6 years once she had enough money saved up she went back home to the philippines and opened up a beauty salon...

then there's always the restaurant route, whether it be big or small...hey people have to eat right? just make sure what your serving them is actually good.

another one could be a...laundromat?
you see a number of them over here and they seem to always be busy, even like a barber shop, grocery store, bed and breakfast?

1. Your company applies online for WP and you get a piece of paper that it is issued. - Max 1 week.
2. They get a medical date - another week max.
3. Finger printing - another 3-4 days.
4. WP card - another 2-3 days.

above days are just from my personal experience and may vary.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>these are two different things.. Tepgam67  is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa. shapil is talking about residence permit. that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice.
Tepgam67, if you have an RP here, to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL.
How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days, sometimes it takes 1 month and even more.

If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa), you cannot work, and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.

again you mix two things. You are already on Work VISA here in qatar. Based on your Work VISA you got your RP. You don't need an additional work PERMIT, since your visa is a WORK visa. Clear?
 Work PERMIT is required for those who are on the Family Visa and wish to work. The author of this thread is on Family Visa and already has her RP, I guess. She might stay in Qatar on Family visa without working (while you cannot stay on Work visa without working). But now she has chosen to work. And all she needs now is a PERMISSION to WORK (Work Permit).

Best move is to apply to other companies...don't just rely on this company because chances of hiring you is 50/50 unless you got your Visa. Good luck..</RelCClean>

			<RelCBody>bringing him on family visit visa (6 months) and sponsoring him for the Residence permit are two different things.

Even IF you are able to bring him on a Family visit visa (6 months), he won't be able to work with this type of visa. The Company who hired him will have to issue a Work Visa for him and will have to take him under its sponsorship.

As for the Residence permit, you won't be able to obtain  RP for him (which is necessary for the Work permit) under your sponsorship. So this is not an option for you.

All you need is to TRY to bring him on Family visa 6 months. THen he will need to find a job and to move under the hiring company sponsorship.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Salleh...salary is relative to what you do for a living. Having said that you can be the best judge of how good or bad your offer is once you've done some research. DO a search in QL. Plenty of threads bout cost of living in Doha.

1. 2 br apartment 8500-12000 pm
2. Groceries for two 2500 pm
3. Water + electricity 500 pm
4. Telephone+internet+cable 500-100 pm
5. Car rental 2000 pm for the likes of Corolla/civic
6. School fees....sorry no idea
7. Other....no idea..depends what your definition is

			<RelCBody>If they can't house you then you dont take it.

Or at least get it in the contract that they will pay your Housing Rent Bill as the rents increase 25% every year. If they agree then the package is good unless you are not a heavy dirnker.

Bilabong is on the spot with the rates.


No.5 is optional and it would depend on the length of your stay. If you Rent-a-car it will be QR2000. If you stay for above 3yrs then it would be better if you buy QR2000 pm for 3yrs you can own the car (corolla/civic) &amp;amp; sell it for QR 25,000-30,000 when you leave Qatar.

			<RelCBody>Is that I can't see a problem with going off topic if the thread is a light one, such as Paul arranging a social get-together or someone putting up a joke for everyone to have a go at or add to etc.

I think the problem is if someone has started a serious thread, which requires a discussion or even an answer to a query they have (if it doesn't fit in the more serious forums), then by hijacking it kind of kills the thread and serves no purpose.

Speaking as someone who found this site when in the UK, before coming over to Doha, I typed into google a question about, say, sports clubs in Doha and found a thread in QL.   It was informative, but I wonder what I would have thought of the site had the thread suddenly disintegrated in people gossiping and heresay and bickering?  For a start I would never had seen some of the REAL info I was looking for and given up, as probably would have the person who posted the question in the first place expecting some knowledge to be imparted!

OK - am going to have a ciggie and down a ginger beer now lol</RelCBody>

Jauntie is right.  I found QL by googling Qatar schools and I found this sight.  If all I had found was bickering and guys trying to pick up women - I don't think I would have come back to it.  It has been a big help.  I have read so many of the threads and come back all the time to read more - informative and very entertaining.  I hope to get there soon so I can join the Social Group.  There are some very interesting people here that I would love to meet in person.  I love meeting people from different places, cultures, etc.  We have been expats on and off for many, many years.  


Nice to see another &amp;quot;Southern Bell&amp;quot; on the sight.  I am not in Doha yet.  My husband is there and I will get there eventually.

Take care and enjoy your time in Doha.

housing you can get a flat for QR 10.000, if you dont have a medical you can apply a health card. With that card you can get a treatment from the government hospital.

			<RelCClean>Cardozo; it depends on your background if it is good enough or not. And if you are happy with the salary then go for it; but if you  believe you should be able to earn more then don't take it.  Remember Salaries in Qatar are low if you compare with Europe; North America and expat salaries in other parts of the world</RelCClean>

			<RelCBody>Um_Nooh and aquabong,

With all respect to cleaners and tea boys. I do respect them a lot and if I had to use ranks, I would consider them all, way above most of the people who exercise a &amp;quot;management&amp;quot; position here in Qatar. Each one of them have a sad story behind them and most of them are heroes suffering under an unjust society.

For your information, from where I come from, a cleaner and a person who serves tea/coffee, is regarded as important as a senior manager and their salaries sometimes are not too apart. The social benefits are equal. We grow up with a diversity of people and racism is just not part of our upbringing!


My reply to Um_Nooh, came out that way because of the way she posted her question!
Anybody could figure out that salaries vary in accordance with the activity you are going to exercise.  Um_Nooh assumed that either we could guess her qualifications and targeted job, or whatever.
My answer was deliberated for her to think about her error and at the same time to highlight the fact that there is NO Qatari in 2010, working as a cleaner! Knowing where she comes from, I deliberated used the professions I did as a wake up call.

In Qatar, a society that treats cleaners and tea boys the way they treat, no one can claim they have class, thus Um_Nooh offended reply tone!
If Um_Nooh have a bit of class, the reply could have been: No, its not those professions, I forgot to specify. The post I am looking for is??</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Nic - when i talked about lack of class and respect, it had nothing to do, and was not directed towards individuals that work as tea/coffee servers, and hence lead to me feeling offended.... it was directed to how you answered me! You were the person that I felt lacked class and respect (and that is without knowing your professional background).


If you want to talk about answering, and stating things appropriately, you could have chosen your words in a more decent manner. Follow what you preach basically. The fact that not only I was offened but another member as well, who if I may add is NOT qatari, shows a lot about your approach.


Please do not assume that just because I am Qatari, I do not value people that work as tea/coffee servers, or anyone else for that matter! Just as you assumed the worst in me, and thought I sterotyped them as being low class citizens, you were a hypocrite to assume that as a Qatari that is how I would think of them! The only person that acted wrongly is you. You made your own assumptions, and stuck to it, without giving me the benefit of the doubt.


Also, on the topic about racism...and upbringing, there are a lot of people from Canada that are racist. You can't say that no one in Canada isn't! I have nothing bad to say though about canadians, as I have known many, and have friends that are canadians, and all of them I love. Whether you want to direct this topic to racism, is another story however, and racism was not on my mind when I responded to you anyway.

I will agree with you in one thing though, which I have to thank you for, and that was to show me that I should have been more specific. You are right. For that I apologize to everyone for letting that slip my mind, and I do agree it is an important factor to point out. At the time when I wrote the message I had a certain thought in mind, and didn't clarify myself.


Anyway ill throw this out to a misunderstanding between the both of us. Thank you for showing me my errors, and I wish you the best.


P.S. There are qataries working as cleaner/tea/coffee ladies =). Many of which I have become friends with. </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Not sure. But if youre going thru an agency in the Philippines like what happened to me, it will take at least 1 month of waiting. But in Doha, based on the processing of our PRO in the office, it only takes a week or less. Even for visa renewal, in one week i can have the original I.D. :)</RelCBody>

I have a friend who asked their help(POLO) regarding of her sponsor instead of helping her they said that my friend needs to go to our embassy so the embassy will help her. When she was in the embassy and asked regarding on that matter the embassy told her to go in OWWA. The OWWA told her to go back to the embassy.So my friend decided to be deported coz no one in our phils govenment agency here didnt help her.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>If you pay the penalty which is 10 Qr per day then you can renew your visa and change your sponsorship too. You have to pay your penalty only for 5 month not for 8 which is 5x30=150.  150x10 = 1500.
either if you go to basmsahba or whatever they call it they will charge u the same amount and air tickets.and they will give the date .

			<RelCBody>   I am taking lessons at Al Rayyah .. Have paid around 1130 for a quarter course...with 12 on road lessons and 6 theory /classroom/simulator classes..After taking 3 or 4 classes, pay another 50 QAR for registering for the test.


   Complete all your theory and on road sessions, and then take ur test. In case ,you( hope you do not) fail in first attempt, you can re-take the test by paying another 250 QAR. Failure on second attempt would entail you to regist for a fresh ( qtr,half or full )course all over again.Pay  a small tip to ur driver and he might teach you some special lessons on clearing the driving test.


All the best and hope you don't turn out to be just another brash driver speeding like a maniac on the roads here in Qatar

as far as i know this 12 hours can be take 1hr/day. Can this also be take like more than an hour per day? Like 4 hrs a day to decreased the numbers of days that you must go to driving school, i mean if 4hrs/session you must go only for 3 days for the lesson, unlike 1hr/session meaning you have to go 12 days.

			<RelCBody>Things to do before you begin drifting...


.
.
.


1. Set up a cone in the middle of the lot. Drive up on the cone and rip the handbrake in an attempt to do a 180. Practice this until you are no more, and no less than 180 degrees from when you started.
.
.
.
.


2. Learn how to countersteer by ripping the handbrake from a speed of 10-20mph and trying to control the car to a destination until the car stops.
.
.
.
.


3. Increase speed of each of these things until you are comfortable.
.
.
.
.
.

4. try to do the 180 cone turn but instead of stopping, hit the gas hard and power out and away from the cone.



Start practicing this first and let me know when you are confident enough about this...

			<RelCBody>My son was playing with some neighborhood kids and they had said to him that Israeli planes were going to drop bombs on everyone and that they kill people when they find them...got him really wound up and scared.

So I explained to him that the other kids were Muslim, and they they believed certain things that we didn't necessarily believe in.  They don't they don't eat pork, we do; we believe in Santa, they don't; etc.


I then went on to explain about how some countries fight and go to war with one another and people get hurt and killed and it's never nice, but it happens.  And hopefully soldiers try to be as careful as they can, but sometimes women and kids and old people and animals get hurt and killed by accident.  It's sad but it happens.

And then I explained that some of our best family friends are Jewish and/or Israelis, and I asked if he knew that (no, he didn't), and then I said that I didn't think that our friends were bad people at all (he agreed), and so I didn't think it was fair for people to say that ALL Israelis were bad.  That there were good and bad people everywhere, all over the world.

He kind of got the idea...

But it IS tough raising kids here...and I know I am going to have to constantly fight this battle, because he will hear it from kids every single year -- on the playground, in class, everywhere.

BTW, we had to do this song-and-dance on another controversial issue: homosexuality.  My son came home one day and announced that when a man loves another man and gets married to him, it's &amp;quot;haram&amp;quot; (LOL -- he didn't even know what that word meant!).  So off I went on my soapbox, trying to explain to him MY point of view that there is nothing wrong with any two adults who love one another...and that when he grows up, he can decide for himself what he thinks is right and wrong about a lot of things.  And that in the meantime, he will hear a lot of different ideas, but that doesn't necessarily make any of them correct or mean that he has to agree with them, even with ideas that I subscribe to.

Whew!  It's tough being a parent!!

			<RelCBody>Intercontinental Tent i think is the best... Very nice food, good sheesha and the entertainment is also good...

Marriott wasnt that good, the food was nice but the sheesha was terrible as was the entertainment, small hall, no AC and very empty.

Ritz Carlton.. Didnt go this year but last year it was amazing... Great Moroccan food, nice entertainment with dancers and live singers and the spinning egyptian man... great sheesha...

I also heard that Diplomatic club is the best in Do7a but good luck trying to get a table, ive tried for soooo long and its always fully booked.. :)

			<RelCBody>Ah, sorry Voyageress, bad wording on my part. They arrive on 28th so will experience a couple of days of Ramdan.

I've heard good things about the InterCon one on the beach as well, but last year we went to InterCon one when it was inside and it was rubbish.

Last two years we've been to Ritz-Carlton and it's been excellent, but it's expensive and we fancied a change.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>NEW DELHI ? The remote, destitute state of Orissa, marred for years by Hindu-versus-Christian violence, erupted in a retaliatory killing on Monday after the murder of a Hindu leader led a mob to burn small Christian churches, prayer halls and an orphanage that had housed 21 children.

The police said a woman?s body, charred beyond recognition, was found inside the church orphanage. The church?s pastor, whom the police did not identify and who was injured in the fire, told the authorities that the body was that of a nun working there. No children were injured.

The attack on the orphanage on Monday, in an isolated district called Bargarh, came after the killing Saturday of a Hindu leader who had been associated with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council, and who was leading a drive to wean local villagers from Christianity. Radical Hindu groups like the council are vehemently opposed to conversions to Christianity, which in India tend to focus on traditionally downtrodden lower-caste and indigenous groups, and have lately taken to conducting mass ceremonies to convert them back to Hinduism.

The Hindu leader who was killed, Laxmanananda Saraswati, was among five people slain by unidentified armed men who stormed a Hindu school in the nearby district of Kandhamal. The police blamed Maoist insurgents who prevail in the area. Mr. Saraswati?s followers, however, blamed Christians, and called for a statewide strike on Monday. The state government ordered all schools closed.

The Press Trust of India reported that Hindu activists, defying an official curfew in the area, paraded through the streets, attacking Christian churches and homes.

Fights broke out in Orissa last Christmas Eve, when one person was killed and churches and temples were damaged. In 1999, a Hindu mob burned an Australian missionary, Graham Staines, and his two children while they slept inside their car. A Hindu has been sentenced to life imprisonment in their deaths. Eleven others who had been convicted were freed by an appeals court in 2005 because of insufficient evidence. Mr. Staines ran a hospital and clinics for leprosy patients.

			<RelCBody>BHUBANESHWAR, India: Protesters set fire to several houses in eastern India on Monday in an area where recent clashes between Hindus and Christians have left at least 11 people dead, police said.

No one was injured in the latest attack in Orissa state, but police feared the arson will increase tension in a region with a history of violence along religious lines.

Senior police official Gopal Chandra Nanda would not say whether the burned homes belonged to Hindus or Christians, but said an investigation was under way. The attacks took place in Tikabali, a town in Kandhamal district that has been the center of the unrest. Police have imposed a strict curfew across the district for the past week.

The violence began late last month with the killing of a Hindu leader, which police blamed on Maoist rebels but Hindu activists blamed on Christian militants.

In apparent retaliation, Hindu hard-liners set fire to a Christian orphanage, killing a Christian woman and seriously injuring a priest. The violence has spread to include mob attacks on churches, shops and homes.

			<RelCBody>INDIA  Hindu Extremists ?Motivate? Christian Girl To Become A Missioner
By T.S. Thomas
December 17, 2008 

BANGALORE, India (UCAN) -- Namrata Nayak?s face combines the trauma and the hope of the whole Christian community in Orissa state, eastern India.
Methodist Bishop Sampath Kumar observed, &amp;quot;Her burn scars have disappeared and there is a smile on her face, hope in her eyes.
?The prelate, who until he retired was presiding bishop of the Methodist Church?s Bangalore Episcopal Area, told UCA News the 10-year-old girl?s lively presence impressed him greatly. &amp;quot;She did not complain about anything, nor did she show any vengeance toward anyone,? Bishop Kumar said. Instead, she came across as a ?happy innocent child who wants to live for Jesus.?
With another child and 24 widows, Namrata traveled 1,400 kilometers to Bangalore in southern India to attend an advance Christmas celebration for women widowed during the recent anti-Christian violence in Orissa.
They are among 50,000 people displaced by anti-Christian violence that began on Aug. 24 and continued for seven weeks. Hindu fanatics who unleashed the violence killed at least 60 people, most of them Christians.
Global Council of Indian Christians, an ecumenical group based in Bangalore, 2,060 kilometers south of New Delhi, organized the Dec. 8 celebration. The council is involved in rehabilitation work for Orissa?s victims.
Namrata, just a fourth-grader, told UCA News she wants to become a missioner to preach Jesus to her enemies, not just her friends. ?It was our enemies who made me courageous and committed,? she explained.
She now stays in a relief camp in Orissa after extremists burned her house in Orissa?s Kandhamal district, where the violence was most acute. Her father, a daily wage earner, ran into the forest, leaving Namrata and her mother.
As the two hid in a bush behind their thatched village church, something exploded nearby, leaving the child with burns on 40 percent of her body.
&amp;quot;About midnight,? Namrata recalled, ?I was hit by a big sound and fire. I thought I was dead. My full body was in pain with burns.
Her mother told UCA News the only Christians there were women, and they could not get help to admit Namrata to a hospital. But when they managed to take her to a local government clinic the next morning, they were told to go to a medical school about 50 kilometers away. So, Namrata finally got medical treatment, 12 hours after the attack.
Media say thousands of people across the globe prayed for Namrata?s speedy recovery after an international news agency published a photo of her burnt face. Sajan K. George, the Global Council president, told UCA News that media organizations sold her photos for millions of dollars but did not help her. &amp;quot;At least 1 percent of it should have been spent for her treatment,? he said.
Namrata credits ?Sajan uncle? with helping her ?very much? by sponsoring her treatment and bringing the group to Bangalore. On that trip, she added, she and the others traveled for the first time by train.
Asked if she is afraid of being a Christian, the girl said she not only will remain a Christian but also wants to become a pracharak (preacher). ?I want to sing and dance during Christmas, distribute cakes and sweets to everyone, and wish happy birthday to my Jesus.

Who is the most persecuted group in the world? Christians. The official IDOP web site states: &amp;quot;As a human rights issue, the persecution of Christians dwarfs all other forms of religious injustice. It is beneficial to take advocacy for fellow believers who suffer for their faith as a starting point, as Christians living in free societies have been largely unaware of or silent to this increasing tragedy.&amp;quot;

I was just browsing the internet and came across this news story dated Nov. 8th.

&amp;quot;An evangelist in the North Indian state of Madhya Pradesh was killed by Hindu priests suspected of seeking human sacrifices for a Hindu &amp;quot;goddess&amp;quot; in the latest in a series of attacks against Christians in the country.

According to the Global Council of Indian Christians, Vipin Mandloli, 27, was shot dead near Aamkut village in the Jhabua District, Madhya Pradesh.

Doctors - Most of the Indians look for Indian doctors because of either language and communication problems or they are not treated well (attitude). Even I have noticed Arabs prefer to go to Arabic speaking doctors so that they can communicate thier illness better.

Restaurants - We prefer all different types of restaurants.  However, we avoid going back to restaurants where we are not treated well.

Regarding other communities, they have no choice as there are not many supermarkets and doctors from their country.</RelCBody>

Was looking in the latest Marhaba (welcome) book and saw that both Starfish and Creative Child take kids beginning at age 1 but if you get here at 10  months it might take 2 months or so on a waiting list anyway. Also, saw Mary Poppins Nursery. Haven't heard anything about this one except one mom was unimpressed when she saw a t.v. in one of the rooms. It's a little bit further down the road from Starfish.


Emails -
starfishkids@hotmail.com
creativechildqatar@yahoo.com
marry_poppins@qatar.net.qa (yes two &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;s)

Also, is there a Qatar Embassy in Canada? If so, give them a call and see if they can send you a copy of the Marhaba book. The Embassy in the US sent us one before we moved over. Lots of basic info on Qatar/Doha and pictures. Sort of a moving here guide. </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Hello,

I got a very similar offer and I rejected some months ago.
Now, with a disaster global economy I would like to came back and have this opportunity again.

With this offer I guess you could save 1.500 $ x month if your life style is not too expensive.

Moreover, I was well impressed about quality of life in Doha (I love sea and sailing).

The reason why I rejected was that I had to move very quick and I was scared of such a big change in my life and no time for fixing some business in my hometown.

My suggestion is to accept and enjoy!

			<RelCBody>Dear fellow,


That's relative...Compare the offer with what you  gettin now, I mean your current income.

Similar to anywhere worldwide , you can live on US$ 1000$ / month or your expensenses may reach as much as ten times (10,000 $)a month.  In qatar, a family can decently  live with 8000-10,000 QR /month + MIDDLE CLASS accomadation 8,000 QR + SCHOOLING 2000 qr a month . That makes around 20,000 QR in total. you may back-calculate any anticipated savings. As to the car, credit business  help getting whatever car you may dream and that cost 2000-3000 QR /month for you to own a 2009 Model -luxuary  car . Don't forget annual vacation, family airtickets and medical insurance costs....

Good Luck</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Abu Dhabi is the best choice.   This is true that these days it is difficult to find accommodation but if you ask your employer to provide you with the accommodation this will be the best solution. I am sure you will never regret the decision.Abu Dhabi has a future with so many real projects in pipeline and specially for a Quantity Surveyor with UK experience this job can be the base for other better opportunities.  Good luck and go for it. Take my advise dont focus on present cost of living as these are highly volatile and misleading when I decided to come over in Doha April this year, it was based on good savings but in realty I found it other way round.  I think when deciding about taking a job in Gulf,  criteria these days should be better opportunity and quality of life and these two things no other city in Gulf provides except great Abu Dhabi.

			<RelCBody>I would be interested in knowing where this is too. =)

So, is QR10,000 too low for service apartments?


Any next-best options, please? Would be glad to hear your inputs.

I've been reading so many conflicting reviews about EZDAN. What are your thoughts? I checked their website once, and I was glad to see my budget fell within the prioce range.

			<RelCBody>In my opinion it is good. I've been working as a PM n doing reasonably well.. but on taking the PMP course, I discovered loads of information on how U can better do the job. That there is more to PM than the traditional ways adopted.

Especially since its done in a structured n organised manner and in international terms which ppl fr all over can understand and identify with. Having the PMP will empower U to take on PM jobs more confidently. Of cos experience also counts.

I am curious how these so called PMPs got their certificate if they cant even vouch for some basic experience. All depends on individual dedication.

I wud say go for it. Good luck. </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>my first trainset was also TOMY, that was 10years ago, which i handed over to my son which for now, only pieces of plastic tracks remains.

i've got my first german model last year which is a starter set. i think its better that both you and your husband will be doing this hobby.  What I am doing is that, i am the one who is in charge of the trains while my wife is the one who's constructing the models (stations, bridges, etc..).  We're still waiting for the accessories that we need to construct our first diorama set (1200x600mm).

try to go to miniatur wunderland website to  check the largest modeltrain assembled.

			<RelCBody>A few of the choices you need to answer before you get started are:
What scale would you want to work with?
What era or region of train type?
How much space do you have for a layout?
The two most popular scales are HO and N gauge, they would have the most accessories available for building a layout. With N gauge you could make a nice little layout on a desktop size area or smaller. With HO scale, you would need at least 2 desktop sized areas to make a small layout on.

			<RelCBody>When you go from Khalifa Stadium towards corniche, reach the firestation roundabout, take a right. You will get Athel;tes village on the right. Keep going straight and you pass a roundabout. Immediately after is an underpass. Dont go to the underpass, but take the road on the right of the underpass. You reach another roundabout. take a u-turn and come back and take the second right turn. You go directly onto the entrance of the bowling centre.

Now about the price, It is the cheapest in the middle east. It is QR 10 for the first game and QR 8 for each subsequent games ( i am not sure about it). On Fridays and other weekends, you may have to book in advance. Its a lovely place with 32 international quality lanes. they have cafeteria and free internet access via wi-fi. Its a rockin place, though not many people know about it.

For bookings etc, contact:

Ph: 4353054, 4329132, 4329140 or 4329178.
Their e-mail address is qatarbowlingcenter@gmail.com

Whew, hope the info was useful.

And like Mila said, there are lots of local weekly competitions on too. The QBC never sleeps, literally!

			<RelCBody>Fridays 10AM - 8PM no entry for bachelors in the malls. I have stayed in Saudi, and ofcourse they do not have such rules coz they are closed on any given day (except after 8pm or so). They too have family days, and even in the parks only families are allowed. Next, i have been to the malls all by myself and noone ever stopped me on a friday. Irrespective of what time i went. This rule is to keep those perverts away who have nothing better to do but stare at women during their free time! </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Braids is not such a big problem. Once I spoke to a kenyan lady who works for Qatar Airways, and she said there are lots of girls who do it (not in a barber's shop, but at home).


Finding out who can do braids is easy, just ask (or better let your wife ask) someone with nicely done braids, who did it for them

The problem is that my wife wants to stop using braids and do hair relaxation, treatment etc. In other words a professional.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Patrice's shop at Vilaggio: go between Commercial bank &amp;amp; The One towards the entrance at the back. His shop is halfway there on your left.
For ladies I can recommend Patrice's wife, Marie Clare. She has her own salon on Salwa road. Between Midmac &amp;amp; Qatar decoration. Rightside. Near Ciao restaurant. The name of her salon is Coiffure Francaise.
No I am not a shareholder with their companies! Just want to give you good advise

			<RelCBody>Do NOT go to Coiffure Francaise.

I went in with very curly hair and asked Marie Claire, the hair dresser, to cut off ONE inch.

She cut at least two inches off the overall length. I already had long layers and she asked me if I wanted layers and ended up cutting VERY short layers. She also cut the very front much shorter than the rest of my hair and then straightened the whole thing. I can not wear it curly because it looks REALLY bad. I have to spend extra time straightening my hair, and it's not growing quickly at all. I can't put it in a pony tail yet, and she cut it three weeks ago.


If you see a girl around Doha that looks like she tried to give herself &amp;quot;the Rachel&amp;quot; at home, that's me.

			<RelCBody>Clearly you should be careful of the words that you use in a forum, because they can be easily taken out of context.

By saying Islam in Qatar is a farce, are you attacking Islam, the Muslims, the people, the institutions...?

The non-Muslim banks, and hotels that allow 2 of the biggest societal problems to occur have the blessing of the government... so whose problem is it, Islam's or the state's?

And, although many think lightly of the 2 problems of Interest and Alcohol, society in Qatar ALL benefit from the laws that prevent alcohol consumption and their effects in public (if you doubt it, go to any UK city centre on Friday night). And those who think interest is not a problem, look at America and the foreclosure situation.

			<RelCBody>Thank you all for your insights and hope that my query will not create any conflict, argument or whatsoever to anyone of you.

As my husband &amp;amp; I were formerly working in Abu Dhabi, UAE and had also experiences availing loans from 2 banks. One from his side on a fixed interest rate &amp;amp; on my side, on a floating interest rate (which I believe is just the same as variable interest rate). Both of which, we had no question about or might probably, from where I got my loan, they have different way of reflecting the added amount in my monthly statements or I was not given enough time to discover about that as I had to settle the loaned amount after just 2 months of availing it as we decided already to move here afterwards.

			<RelCBody>&amp;lt;Chuckling here&amp;gt; Saving money... good advice always!!
Luckily Doha is a bit more about an adventure for both of us actually. We realized as comfortable as we were in the States, we were playing it a bit safe with Life. It's not that money isnt nice (it is) but the numbers are letting us pursue a bit of housing fun at the same time. Since my offer wont let me convert housing to a per diem I either spend it or lose it. Sooooo we're shopping around for the lifestyles of the not so rich but certainly shameless ;)

Thanks Mandi, will check out West Bay Lagoon. Cristiani is already pressing me for the Pearl and since I'll be at the Airport, betting I'm in for a 30-45 minute commute already....

As a matter of biology; if it bites you it's probably female!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>QF has a standardized classification level that ties in with pay.  The pay level depends upon the needs of the job, not on your qualifications.  $25K QR plus benefits is actually a really high classification level, i think as a Senior Manager / Director type of position.  $16,000 QR is more than many teachers make in Doha, so I would think that is probably a good salary, but again it depends on the job.  The Housing and transport allowance makes up for any salary discrepancies you might encounter.  QF is pretty fair about pay, and is an employer of choice in Qatar.</RelCBody>

I went shopping to Carrefour and I couldn't find any of the Al Marai products. I actually like this brand the most, when it comes to juices, milk, yoghurts...but I couldn't find any of them in there anymore.

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Anyone has any idea what happened? Why Carrefour doesn't have them anymore?

As a result many brands sometimes appear like they've been removed completely until they get around to restocking them.....which takes WAY too long for some reason.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
If there's something specific I need, I usually check out Giant or Family Food Center, and most of the time one of them will have it.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Hope that helps.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Perfection does not exist. The question therefore, is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?

Anjas, i?said Carrefour...?
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Ragnarock, i know what u mean, but it is just weird that all the products from this brand were suddenly not available... so i don't think it was the issue of stocking up. and as Fembot said, they won't say why those products are no longer available.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

But like I said with other brands (though maybe with not as WIDE a range of products) they have gone missing for a LONG time then suddenly showed up....so we are forced to do the stockpiling thing when they ARE available LOL...sad, but this is how its done here if you want to ensure you don't run out of the brands you like.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The best advice I can give you is ask to speak to a manager (in the admininstration department, not just a floor section manager in the store) next time you are there, and inquire about the brand specifically. And IF for some reason they did stop carrying it, you should be able to find them in other stores (unless the whole country decides to ban them for whatever reason).
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

Then Carrefour is cheaper,
yet that does not mean that Carrefour provides the best choices.[Note: what you buy from them has warrenty].
If you are looking for acertain brand with special specificatins, you might not find it at carrefour...
So what you pay for is what you get according to what you want whether in Jarrir , Carrefour or any other place.
We can say one thing: they both are the most popular and saffest to buy from.

			<RelCBody>Another one of these questions written most probably by a Qatarbeautyshop employee/owner with the answer being reference to Qatarbeautyshop in the first 3 posts...

It is not difficult to find small and extra small sizes in Qatar.


As for Qatarbeautyshop, i'd personally would not buy clothes online unless i've tried them out - and i'm a guy. Women are more picky. Moreover shopping in malls/window shopping is one big pastime in Qatar - sorry but your business may not be that feasible in Qatar. Nevertheless wish you all the best however please stop these posts - it is very cheap and does not look good for your business.

			<RelCBody>The W website says January, but word on the street is early spring.  Looking at how fast La Cigale is opening, it more then likely won't be till late spring.   It's the first of something like 14 starwood hotels that will be opening in the next couple of years. 


W is a boutique hotel, which means that all the furniture and stuff is for sale.  Cool eh. :)  Just google W for more information, I promise you won't just get a bunch of Bush sites.

			<RelCBody>You must also remember what was originally on the site of the Mall in the old arport area.
That massive and squalid shanty town.
The Center was the only decent large shop and it had BHS as one of its franchises although many of the items for sale were not BHS products, just BHS labels sewn on in the wrong place.
There was a Shwarma stall in the car park and a cafe inside that served many dishes. Both were operated by &amp;quot;The Caravan&amp;quot;.
The only other shop of any size was Salam Studios, on Al-Saad Street. Now the site of the QP offices and HSBC. Salam Plaza didn't open until the early/mid 80's I seem to recollect.
If there was something that you wanted and couldn't find, Globe China was the place to go. </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>growing up I don't remember any traffic jams!!!  Life was calm and peaceful...I do remember going with my Mum to the souq for shopping (spices, perfumes, material for clothing, nuts, etc)  Now they deliver to us!  But we still go once in a while.  I remember going to Europe a few times a year (staying in our houses in London and Paris and travelling around) and we would always have a long list of things to buy and take back.  Clothes, shoes, medicines, foodstuffs...endless list.  Now the list is shorter as there is so much more available to buy in Doha and online buying with shipping is easier.  Some of my older relatives remember Doha as a walled city with a curfew at night.  Someone came along to light the gaslamps (?) at sunset and during Ramadan someone came through the streets at Suhoor time to wake everyone up to eat before the fasting began for the day. 


Dweller, you've got a good memory...I had forgotten about Salam Studios on Al Sadd St.  My Dad used to shop there a lot. 


I remember when The Mall opened on D ring Road.  It was so exciting!!!</RelCBody>
			<RelCClean>growing up I don't remember any traffic jams!!! Life was calm and peaceful...I do remember going with my Mum to the souq for shopping (spices; perfumes; material for clothing; nuts; etc) Now they deliver to us! But we still go once in a while. I remember going to Europe a few times a year (staying in our houses in London and Paris and travelling around) and we would always have a long list of things to buy and take back. Clothes; shoes; medicines; foodstuffs...endless list. Now the list is shorter as there is so much more available to buy in Doha and online buying with shipping is easier. Some of my older relatives remember Doha as a walled city with a curfew at night.
