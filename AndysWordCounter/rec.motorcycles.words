Suggest McQuires #1 plastic polish.  It will help somewhat but nothing 
will remove deep scratches without making it worse than it already is.
McQuires will do something for fine or light stuff.

Also suggest calling your local plastic shop.  In Calif. "TAP PLASTIC" is
a chain that carries most of what is needed for repair and sometimes
I'm not sure how amenable they are to shipping.  I have found that they
have several excellent products for cleaning, and removing crap from
works real well in removing sticky stuffs such as adhessives from plastic

			How do I get a DoD number?

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is "What is the
DoD?", then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be "How do I
get a DoD number?" That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List
(KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling
creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can
that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)

just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole
net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.

By now you're probably asking "So who's the KotL already?". Well, as
John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real "secret" left around
here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,
the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the
KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely
oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting
messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with "weenie
mailers"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a


Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically
groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed
work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting
something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)
days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of
economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet
another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it
just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an
excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least
annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request
was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think


One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what
they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?
The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &


requirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as
there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)

            "Denizens of Doom", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)

      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]

There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal 
things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  
motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  
seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, 
traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double 
entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They 
argue with each other and plan rides together.

The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, 
although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each 
other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world 
and communicate with each other electronically via computer.

posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred 
to as the DoD.

The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of 
parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer 
enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, "Denizen 
of Doom."  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of 
the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of 
course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.

The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules 
List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been 
almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and 
Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, 
Germany, Norway and Finland.

Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run 
of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the 
few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were 
donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 
to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs 
in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.

As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go 
riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of 
DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's 
"Silicon Valley."  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on 
Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California 
"Joust."

barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern 
meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan 
for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction 
with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.

Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective 
communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional 
motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in 
get together.  Long may they flame.



This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which 
you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do 
issuing them is called "flaming."  Flames often start when a member 
disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A 
typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be 
poseur!"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense 
of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding 
ability and your cat.



                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011

Periodically the question "What is DoD?" is raised. This is one of
those questions in the same class as "Why is the sky blue?", "If there
is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?" and "Why do
women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they
dump you?", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,
and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion
by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the
halls of academe for generations. 

A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few
minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on
machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another
via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but
who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of
the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and
signed it "The Denizen of Doom". Not wishing to identify himself, he
asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time
become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit
about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking
individual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. 

He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was
the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty
easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership
number. 

Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a
motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or
make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized
electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a
part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a
gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the
sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who
wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen
to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight
ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open
minded enough to accept us as members. 

In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have
never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet
feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some
of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized
and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the
network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list
(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the
same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating
around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by
distributed on VHS by #18)! 

Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,
management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each
participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?
Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal

The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net
access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only
ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few
really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a
membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which
includes name, state, and email address. 

The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least
until next year when we may decided to change the name).

                    Why you have to be killed.

Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed
to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started
as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.

stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?" Naturally, a
Denizen who had watched the movie "Top Gun" a few times too many rose

"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you."

And the rest is history.

A variation on the "security" theme is to supply disinformation about
what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where

Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)		Doers of Donuts
Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)		Debasers of Daughters
Dickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death
Debauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes

Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be
limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.


                     The rec.moto.photo archive

First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck
Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,
and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in
unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate
for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not
the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.

Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk
server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,
the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.

Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how
to use the archive.

why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?
Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind
of you to access it after normal working hours (California time). 


                      Patches? What patches?

You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &
perhaps "That's sick! I want!"

Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that
news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't
because of any "exclusivity" attempt, but simply because there is no
"DoD store" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by
individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is
someone says "I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost
$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?" Then
orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the
DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or
produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all
this is anarchy in action.

Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and
perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),
(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and
patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by
popular demand].

All "profits" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association
Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been
contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,
you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of "Denizens
of Doom, USENET, The World", complete with a DoD pin.


Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.


I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,
the other day.


Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the
Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is
now $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude
to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently
being prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to 
see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,
I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank 
you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the
museum, and the fulfillment of its goals.

                                Sincerely,


                                Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395
                                Director

P.S.  Please post on your computer bulletin board."

As you all know, even though the letter was addressed to me personally,
it was meant for all of you who purchased DoD goodies that made this
amount possible.

Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third
year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass
trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got
together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north
as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of
North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great
Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for
riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have
come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]

in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I
finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where
I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling
everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago,

Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street,
feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got
the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous
racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I
saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance...
Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and
someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with
a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid
up beside me and asked, "Friend of yours, Steve?".  "Shit, Matty,
it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!"

Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet
before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him.
Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick.
While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed
to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty
minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty
presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror
and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack
and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the
bike.

I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly
afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty
told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went
uncontested.

                    All standard disclaimers apply.

I must say, that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as I meet other bikers while
riding does a lot of good things to my mood... While riding is a lot of fun by
itself, there's something really special about having someone say to you "Hey,
it's a great day for a ride... Isn't it wonderful that we can spend some time
on the road on days like this..." with a gesture.

Was sunny today for the first time in a week, took my bike out for a spin down
to the local salvage yard/bike shop... ran into about 20 other people who were
down there for similar reasons (there's this GREAT stretch of road on the way

I didn't know, but who were my kinda people nonetheless.

1 hr/drink for the first 4 drinks.
1.5 hours/drink for the next 6 drinks.
2 hours/drink for the rest.

These are fairly cautious guidelines, and will work even if you happen to 
have a low tolerance or body mass.
I think the cops and "Don't You Dare Drink & Drive" (tm) commercials will 
usually say 1hr/drink in general, but after about 5 drinks and 5 hrs, you 
could very well be over the legal limit. 
Watch yourself.

then why does it go down?


So do most helmetless motorcyclists.





I was raised in the South, and I can attest that this is true.  Why, on
one particularly hot day, as I was walking along the road, some good
ole boys in a truck tossed me a cold beer!  Of course, they were going
50 mph at the time...


Bikers wave to bikers the world over.  Whether or not Harley riders
wave to other bikers is one of our favorite flame wars...



That sounds like an awfully closed minded, intolerant attitude.


I'm not a redneck but . . . try a walk in their shoes first.  Stereotypes
are usually of very limited value.  I've seen as many ignorant
as I have ignorant "red necks".  I don't see a correlation. I don't
believe that the "redneck" culture, if you can call it that, is
necessarily inferior or superior to any other.  

I gotta have a beer, I'm making too much sense.  Next thing you know,
I'll be preaching tolerance . . .. and I'm a conservative.

}first I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing),

As someone who was told quite firmly by 2 Honda sales/service weenies
that there is no larger tank available for the Hawk (I have a '91
Hawk with the puny 3.2 gal tank), I'd be very interested to know if
there is any decent aftermarket solution. I'd love to have at least
a 4 gal tank.

Hi, Ravi

If you need a Harley, we have lots to spare here. All the yuppies
bought 'the best' a couple  of years ago to pose at the (s)wine
bar. They 'rode a mile and walked the rest'. Called a taxi home and 
went back to the porsche. So there's are loads going cheap with about
1 1/2 miles on the clock (takes a while to coast to a halt).

Once you are fully covered, you no longer tuck, just lie back and enjoy the

by saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650.  Additionally,
it had a CBR900RR style tank, full fairing, and only a tach.  Now, at
first I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing),
but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally,
the gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like 
900RR gauges.  Overall, the bike looked like a 900RR except for the

Allan, I know the circumstances of several of your falls.
On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you,
you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when
you knew the road was damp, and you reacted badly when
you were surprised by an oncoming car.  That crash was
due to factors that were subject to your control.

I won't deny that there's a combination of luck and skill
involved for each of us, but it seems that you're blaming
bad luck for more of your own pain than is warranted.

This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court
a few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and
plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity
to listen to some of the "creative excuses" offered the judge by others.

After listening to a number of "Well, I was passing a very slow truck
that suddenly speed up" versions, I decided that the judge had heard
just about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than
impressed with any of them.

This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a
rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper.
He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph
zone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had
alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.

The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose
fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for
your self?"

"Well Sir", meekly the defenant replied, "I just was over to my
buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home."
He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and
was doing 110 mph on his way home.

The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the
maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him
to attend remedial drivers training school.

Isn't America Great??

able to maintain a clean line.  And while I'm still known to slide the
occasional tire, I much prefer to stay just to the sticky side of that
line.  I've found that I don't heal as well as I used to in days of yore.

Nice to hear from you again!


Hurt Study.   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity
to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, Hurt et al recommended
that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function
provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the
gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the 
rider doesn't.  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers
have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the 
CBR900RR and the GTS1000A.

  Can you beat this ticket?  Personally, I think it's your Duty As a Citizen
to make it as much trouble as possible for them, so maybe they'll Give Up
and Leave Us Alone Someday Soon.
  The cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing
your speed.  Mr. Brown (the author of Fight Your Ticket) mentions an
Oakland judge who convicted a speeder "on the officer's testimony that
the driver's car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed."
  You can pay off the State and your insurance company, or you can
take it to court and be creative.  Personally, I've never won that way
or seen anyone win, but the judge always listens politely.  And I haven't
seen _that_ many attempts.
  You could try the argument that since bikes are shorter than the
cars whose speed the nice officer is accustomed to guessing, they therefore
appear to be further away, and so their speed appears to be greater than
it actually is.  I left out a step or two, but you get the idea.  If you
can make it convincing, theoretically you're supposed to win.
  I've never tried proving the cop was mistaken.  I did get to see
some other poor biker try it.  He was mixing up various facts like
the maximum acceleration of a (cop) car, and the distance at which
the cop had been pacing him, and end up demonstrating that he couldn't
possibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested.  He'd
brought diagrams and a calculator.  He was Prepared.  He lost.  Keep
in mind cops do this all the time, and their word is better than yours.
Maybe, though, they don't guess how fast bikes are going all the time.
Besides, this guy didn't speak English very well, and ended up absolutely
confounding the judge, the cop, and everyone else in the room who'd been
recently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota.
  Ahem.  OK, I'm better now.  Maybe he'd have won had his presentation
been more polished.  Maybe not.  He did get applause.

Check with the local fire department.  My buddy is a firefighter and they
have these small map books which are Amazing!  They are compact, easy to
use (no folding).  They even have a cross reference section in which you
match your current cross streets with the cross streets you want to go to
and it details the quickest route.  They gave me an extra they had laying
around.  But then again I know all those people I'm not really sure if they
are supposed to give/sell them. (The police may also have something
similar).
 





As summer approaches, the usual preparations are being made...

Me was thinking of going for some overnite camping trips in the local
state forests. For that I was planning to get a backpack/rucksack. 
The next question is how shall I carry the thing on the bike, given
the metal frame and all. I have a big backrest (approx 12" high) and
was hoping that I would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest.

Any one have any experiences on such experimentation?

Taking the idea further, what would happen if the backpack was fully
loaded with a full load (40lbs). Is the load distribution going to 
be very severly affected? How will the bike perform with such a load 
clinging to the back rest. If I really secure it, with no shifting, 
do I still increase my chances of surfing?


Collective r.m. wisdom requested.  


p.s. I really can't afford leather pants. Boots and jeans are
all I can make do with. What you think of the knee protectors

I ride my bike regularly to classes with my book bag.  I take
the shoulder straps on the bag, and hook them around the rear turn
signals.  I works fine.  You probably will want to attach it with
a bungee cord to keep it from shifting to one side or another.





Sure, I can. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles, edited by Erwin 
Tragatsch, was published by The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited, 
Astronaut House, Hounslow Road, Feltham, Middlesex, England.

It was first published in 1977, and mine was reprinted in 1978. Cost then 
was Pounds 5.95 in the UK, though I paid 18.50 for it in Canadian 
dollars. I have no idea whether it's still in print. Perhaps you could 
let the net know.

and just 'HONDA' for decals, I've seen such a bike numerous times over
I didn't see it over at the EC parking lot (I buzzed over there on my 
way home, all of 1/2 block off my route!)  but it was gone.

Is a single sided swingarm available for the CBR?  I would imagine so, 
kinda neccisary for quick tire changes.  When I first saw it, I assumed it
was a bike repainted to cover crash damage.

Put the pack on the pillion and bungee it to the backrest.
If that is not possible then you should be able to bungee it behind the
backrest, just make sure it doesn't bend or break anything like the rear
fender or turnsignals.


I rented one once.  That car would ruin the name "Zephyr" for any other

This morning a truck that had been within my sight (and I within
his) for about 3 miles suddenly forgot that I existed and pulled
edge of his front passenger door as I was accelerating past him.

It was trivial enough for me to tap the brakes and slide behind him
as he slewed over (with no signal, of course) on top of me, with
my little horn blaring (damn, I need Fiamms!), but the satisfaction
of being aware of my surroundings and thus surviving was not enough,
especially when I later pulled up alongside the bastard and he made
no apologetic wave or anything.

Is there some way that I can memorize the license plate of an
offending vehicle and get the name and address of the owner?

That's absurd! That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor
of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles.  Any argument
for lifeguards is an argument against swimming.  It says that any agrgument
in favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to 
which the precautions apply.  Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous,

Also, even though most people do not ride motorcycles, they do boat, sail,
skate, rollerblade, skateboard, play rugby (ouch), mow the lawn, rewire
the basement, operate heavy machinery,  and do a host of other 'dangerous'
things that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban.
Your little homily applies to all those things, and the general public
buying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activity
would be next is unlikely.

What a great day! Got back home last night from some fantastic skiing

I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once.

It was like being kicked by my karate instructor.

No accident, but my eyes were tearing so hard, and I was wheezing
so loudly, that it's quite remarkable that I was able to come
to a stop with the rubber side up.

The duck, BTW, lived, and seemed quite healthy, though we both
sat by the roadside and shook our heads for a few minutes.

Be VERY careful about this. If youre really cold the muffler will
feel fine till you leave all the charred skin on it when you peel
kindsa (Americanism of the day) damage to your circulation warming 
hands up on something too hot. By far the best (fastest and safest)
way to do it is to shove the hands up the opposit sleeves and
stand there like a Ming emporer for a while. Five minutes should 
do it.
One thing is certain, though, its still too cold.  After about 40

Hell! This is WARM. I retired my fleece from under the Aerostich last 
month when the temperature got aboce 40. Try living a couple of years 
on the dole, so you cant afford any heating. You put the gear on in
October, abd you take it off again in May. Getting out on the bike 
seems like a luxury in comparison cos oyur usuallu going somewhere 
warm. 

Its all relative.



Yeah, hypothermia is MUCH more detrimemtal to your judgement and reactions
than people realise. I wish I had the patience to stop when I should. One
day I'll pay for it....

till the shivering stops, this doesnt mean you're OK again, it means 
and body are working about as fast as a tree grows. You will not realise
this yourself till you hit something. The next stage is passing out. 
This usually means falling off.

This is a piece of psychology its essential for any long term biker to
understand. People do NOT think 'if I do this will someone else suffer?'.
They assess things purely on' if I do this will I suffer?.


To maintain my senses at their sharpest, I never eat a full meal
within 24 hrs of a ride.   I've tried Slim Fast Lite before a 
ride but found that my lap times around the Parliament Buildings suffered 
0.1 secs.   The resultant 70 pound weight loss over the summer
just sharpens my bike's handling and I can always look

Because of this I cannot in good faith recommend a Seca Turbo.  Power
delivery is too uneven for a novice.  The Official (tm) Dod newbie
bike of choice would be more appropriate because the powerband is so wide

Who mentioned dirtbikes? We're talking highway speeds here. If you go 70mph

Because it wouldn't be a Jeep if it didn't. A friend of mine just bought one
becuase it's a big 4 wheeler). Anyway, it's written in about ten places that
the windshield should remain up at all times, and it looks like they've made
it a pain to put it down anyway, from what he says. To be fair, I do admit
that it would be a similar matter to drive a windscreenless Jeep on the 
highway as for bikers. They may participate in this discussion, but they're
probably few and far between, so I maintain that this topic is of interest
primarily to bikers.


Notice how Ed picked on the more insignificant (the lower case part) of the 
two parts of the statement. Besides, around here it is quite rare to see 
bikers wear goggles on the street. It's either full face with shield, or 
open face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses. My experience of 
sunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes.


Ok, ok, fine, whatever you say, but lets make some attmept to stick to the
point. I've been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean

specific this time, so that even Ed understands. Does anbody think that 
splattering bugs with one's face is fun, or are there other reasons to do it?
Image? Laziness? To make a point about freedom of bug splattering?


In my case it goes down after the first four, because the fifth one usually
makes me throw up the last two.

Needless to say, I don't drink very much anymore, as the last time that
happened was in the second year of my undergrad. I was a silly .edu breath,
and pretty bad breath at that.


I told a newbie friend of mine, who was having trouble from the complicated
explanations of his rider course, to think of using the handlebars to lean,
not to turn. Push the right handlebar "down" (or pull left up or whatever)
to lean right. It worked for him, he stopped steering with his tuchus.

My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding
jacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would
like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.


1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs
    due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.
    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact
    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates
    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.

2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new 
    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather
    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose
    than upper Aerostich.

Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other 
lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, 
shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a 
reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would 
be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below
freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

Please fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...

Hi, I just have a small question about my bike. 
think about my Honda. 
She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike 
week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and 
was running only on one cylinder. 
I towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect 
working order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look 
very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All 
still within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a 
slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), 
this bike. 
Any syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone 
order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the 
wear of my pistons??
Please send comments to

  I am selling my trusty Husky... hopefully to buy a Husaberg...  This is
  a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had
  any problems with it.

  It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than 
  a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better 
  suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non
  competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.
  You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear
  changes.
  
  The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike
  very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a
  custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect
  the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced 
  by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better

  So if it is such a good bike why sell it???? Gee, I want to buy a Husaberg,
  which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter... and a tad more $$$.

I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my post about 
fighting my ticket.

Many of you wrote to say that you have successfully fought and won your 
case in court.  Others lost due to the cop outright lying to the judge 
about the circumstances surrounding your ticket, while one fellow lost
because the judge just didn't appear to be in the mood for such foolishness.

Several of you suggested that I obtain a book called "Fight Your Ticket".

The general theme from those who said "go for it", was to be prepared.  
I should do as much research as possible, go back and review the scene, 
transcribe what happened to tape or paper, use any witnesses that may 
have been around, have a list of questions to ask the cop and/or the judge,

A few people suggested trying to get my court date changed, as this might 
trip up the arresting officer, he may not show up if the date is on his day
off or if he feels/knows that he doesn't have a chance to win against you.

One individual stated that an Officer could be an Expert Witness, and if he
says I was speeding, then by damn, I was speeding.

Another says that I must have been paced or clocked with a radar gun.

Lots of good suggestions and ideas from you all.  I'll let you know what
happens after the big day!

 event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner, Rally Chairman,
 "The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more
 complete facility led us to Quincy.  Plus we can get there on either of our
 Canyon, or up from the South via the Northernmost part of the Gold Country's
 Highway 49."
 
 	
 	The Quincy Fairgrounds is located on California State Highway 70/89,
 two miles South of downtown Quincy.
 
 Hubbard, BMW Club of Northern California, 41236 Norman Court, Fremont, CA

   This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.
   Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one
   to make.  The only problem has been that there are so
   many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.

   Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.
   For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa, 
   Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.
   There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.
   Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us. 
   Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early
   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays
   for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday
   with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the
   awards ceremony.  

   For members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on 
   registration declaration of affilitation.  There will of course
   and greatest distance, one up & two up and all the usual things.

it onto it's centerstand, chipped the heck out of the paint on it...
 
 So I cheerfully spent $.59 on a bottle of testor's model paint and 
repainted the scratches and chips for 20 minutes.
 
 Then, while it was drying, I realized that I was out of smokes and that my 
cage is not currently running... So I "had to" take my bike down to the 
store. Not wanting to mess up my paint job, I said "Well, heck. I can just 
use my old helmet".... this is your standard el cheapie openface... 
  
 I didn't notice a big difference when I switched TO the shoei, but 
switching back was really bad... 
 
 1) Doesn't fit worth a damn, too wide in the sides, too short front to 
back...
 2) With a faceplate, it's still bloody windy... with the shoei, I normally 
ignore the face shield until I get up to about 30ish... with this one, 
taxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind. 
 
  
 
certain who's gonna ride with you (like say you meet them at a .... church 
meeting, yeah, that's the ticket)... What are some guidelines? Should I just 
pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet (XL), or should I 
maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely 
passenger? 

So what's your local hospital's favorite curse?

Hello all,

On my bike I have hazard lights (both front and back turn signals
flash).  Since I live in NJ and commute to NYC there are a number of
tolls one must pay on route.  Just before arriving at a toll booth I
switch the hazards on.  I do thisto warn other motorists that I will
be taking longer than the 2 1/2 seconds to make the transaction.
Taking gloves off, getting money out of coin changer/pocket, making
transaction, putting gloves back on takes a little more time than the
average cager takes to make the same transaction of paying the toll.
I also notice that when I do this cagers tend to get the message and
usually go to another booth.

My question, is this a good/bad thing to do?

Any others tend to do the same?

Just curious



   Watch out.  Often when some scumbag steals the cover, that means
   that they were or are looking to steal the bike.  In my case, I
   had a faded cover stolen off a bmw R100RS that was stashed in an
   apartment carport and not visible from the street.  They evidently
   decided the beemer wasn't worth stealing, but did try the next night to
   steal a Honda Hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.
   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.


I know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the
things that is really good about BMW bikes.  From all accounts I've
heard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto
Guzzis and other relative "exotics" since there isn't a large demand
for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. It seems
that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes.

hello there
comment on its handling .



A couple of other tips.

1) Make a habit of parking the bike so that instruments are facing away
   from the sun.

2) Meguiar's Mirror Glaze Plastic Polish & Plastic Cleaner. (Cue canned


What you want are Meguiar's Mirror Glaze Plastic Polish and Plastic
Cleaner. They are very mild abrasives meant to remove scratches from
plastic. For fine scratches just use the Polish, for bigger ones start
bottle at most auto or motorcycle parts stores. Don't choke over the
price too much, since both bottles will probably last you 10 years. The
stuff works great on plastic watch "crystals" and compact discs too.

Yo, did anybody see this run of HARD COPY?

I guy on a 600 Katana got pulled over by the Police (I guess for
speeding or something).  But just as the cop was about to step
out of the car, the dude punches it down an interstate in Georgia.
Ang then, the cop gives chase.

Now this was an interesting episode because it was all videotaped!!!
Everything from the dramatic takeoff and 135mph chase to the sidestreet
battle at about 100mph.  What happened at the end?  The guy (who is
being relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights)
slows a couple of times to taunt the cop.   After blowing a few stop
signs and making car jump to the side, he goes up a dead end street.

The Kat, although not the latest machine, is still a high performance
machine and he slams on the brakes.  Of couse, we all know that cages,
especially the ones with the disco lights, can't stop as fast as our
high performance machines.  So what happens?...  The cage plows into the
Kat.

Luckily for this dude, he was wearing a helmet and was not hurt.  But
dude, how crazy can you get!?!  Yeah, we've all went out and played
cat and mouse with our friends but, with a cop!!???!!!  How crazy can
to convince me not to try any shit like that.  (Although the dude
collided with a car head on at 140 mph, the Kawasaki team colors
still looked good!!!  Just a few scratches, like no front end....
3 inch long engine and other "minor" scratches...)

If you guys are out there, please, slow it down.  I not being
an advocate for the cages (especially the ones that make that 
annoying ass noises...), but just think...  The next time you
do it" 250 Ninja), just remember, a kid could step out at any   
time.

Peace & ride (kinda) safe.

  Not with a hub cap but one of those "Lumber yard delivery

spackle came off at 70 mph. It got real interesting for about
20 seconds or so. Had to use a wood mallet to get all the dried
spackle off Me, the Helmet and the bike when I got home. Thanks 
to the bob tail Kenworth between me and the lumber truck I had
a "Path" to drive through he made with his tires (and threw up
the corresponding monsoon from those tires as he ran over
what ever cans of spackle didn't burst in impact). A car in

nailed a bridge abutment half way through the second 360.

The cut is only about as deep as the tread block, and looks like it
only scratched the rubber at the base, but the weird thing is, it's
way over on the edge where I haven't scuffed the tire in yet.
1. How dangerous is this, should I replace the tire right away?
and
2. If I should, since the cut is on the unscuffed portion and the
tire only has about 330 mi on it, what do you think my chances of
getting it replaced under warranty are?

To the nedod mailing list, and Jack Tavares suggested I check out
how old the tire is as one tactic for getting it replaced.  Does
anyone have the file on how to read the date codes handy?

Thanks,

Back in my youth (ahem) the wiffy and moi purchased a gadget which heated up
water from a 12V source.  It was for car use but we thought we'd try it on my
above 7000.  Any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement.

It made for interesting cups of coffee, anyhow.  We would plot routes that
contained straights of over three miles so that we had sufficient time to
get the water to boiling point.  This is sometimes difficult in England.

Good luck on your quest.

Because they add a lot of expense and complexity and make for a less reliable

of chrome to replace the black plastic that wings come so liberally

is a piece of SAFETY EQUIPMENT. The fact that Honda clearly places
concern for their profits ahead of concern for my safety is enough
to convince me that this (my third) wing will likely be my last.

I can't think of another subject that generates as much contradictory
advice as traffic laws and their enforcement.  Everybody's got an
opinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information is
extremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don't
know.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle code
only tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a
wide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear any
advice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.

If you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code,
study it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really
happens.  Read "Fight Your Ticket" too, but don't miss the little
section at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you're
basically screwed.

As you may have guessed, I'm pretty down on the system here in
California.  I've carefully prepared for court, bringing witnesses and
revealing serious holes in the officer's story, only to be slapped with
message clear that the judge does not appreciate John Q Public trying
his own cases.

    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses
in the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.

1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force
air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake
valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only
the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after
the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the
intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing
atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time
does the pressure ever become "negative", or even approach a good
vacuum.

2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the
combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up
to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume
of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume
that must flow through the intake, because of the temperature
difference and the products of combustion.

paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty
zero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very
well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make
very little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is
_much_ louder than the stocker.


5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any
given RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it
on the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.
Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.




 me think about how I viewed alcohol and intoxication.  You may seem fine, but your reactions may be affected such that you'll be unable to recover from hitting a rock or even just a gust of wind.  I greatly enjoy social drinking but, for me, it just doesn't mix with riding.

Thanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom. 

As recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was
said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low 
numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked
great.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great! 
It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.  
I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those 
who posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.  
( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should
be road legal tomorrow.  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about 
the transmission and taking my chances.

Being a reletively new reader, I am quite impressed with all the usefull
info available on this newsgroup.  I would ask how to get my own DoD number,

get screwed.

Now, I am jumping into the middle of this thread so I may not know


There are a number of other factors that are very important, the three
biggest being air velocity, air momentum and shock waves.
Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside
of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the
stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air
rushing in.
the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside
Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from
escaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion
chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)
to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they
design for shock waves.

Mark,

  47k is not too many miles on a VFR750.  I sold my (well maintained)
'87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.
All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings
and seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers
to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was
mint.

   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k
miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.
There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.
I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all
said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.

   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain
it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my
VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.
Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.

Good luck,

For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think
about airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from 
Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated
at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to
the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay
pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used
a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.
	I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front
fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube
frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to
do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two
vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing
follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.
The compressor is about 2" in diameter and about 5" long.
	The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small
so there should be plenty of good places for it.
	I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to
mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side
just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the
horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where
the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough
room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice
cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.
	The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out
about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look
closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight
ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).
	If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try
to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them
first.
more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.
I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has
not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).
	I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though
they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping
the pedestrians on the sidewalk.
The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to
those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)
and are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.

As you point out, the experiments would be difficult. But we know
enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.
There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over
to begin a turn.

	1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.

	2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.

	3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a
	torque which twists the bike over.

Take an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5,
15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be
needed to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each
effect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at
high speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off
bugger all, relatively speaking.

all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners?

 I hate to  admit this but there does seem to be some sort of twisted logic
to this approach. It's the bikers against the world and the dogs are just 
another worthless adversary. So remember to wear at least calf height leather
boots, ( in case the dog gets lucky and sinks his teeth into your
attacking foot) and go for the gusto, If that dog doesn't retreat from the
street with his tail between his legs next time you see it then you really
haven't done your bit for all your fellow bikers.

First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice
between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is
only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put
the dog first.

Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react
to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're
playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which
has hostile intent.

Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social
beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are
dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the
But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may
even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh
rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!

Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to
assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a
when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of
interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so
that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to
react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a
motorcycle is capable of.

With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures
road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up
newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will
hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is
that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The
larger the dog, the greater your anger.

Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he
are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he
is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.

Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory
where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are
satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped
punishment.

The interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great
deal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the
less you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast, I've
learned a few tricks I think...

The problem is that Squids and BadAssBikers can't recognize
each other's waves.  When you're riding a cruiser, you "wave"
by lifting two or three fingers of the left hand, without
first removing that hand from the handlebar.  When you're
riding a crotch rocket, you lower the left hand to about
ankle level, palm forward, and call that a wave.

Generic bike riders actually seem to raise the hand entirely
off the handlebar and wave it around, so it's easy to tell
when they're waving.

I'll throw in a vote for a Metzler "economy" tire, the ME77. Good
my 12 mile ride(twisties) to work well on the SR500. Costs a bit 
more than the Chengs/IRC's etc, but still less than the Sport
Metzlers for the newer bikes. Cost from Chaparral is about $60 for the
front, and $70 for the rear.


I have had this happen to me often enough that I always look for it.
On my ride to work in the morning I come to a stop light where there are
3 lanes in my direction.  One for left turns, one for straight through, and
one for right turns.  All clearly marked.  Plus there is a clearly marked 
bicycle lane.  I ride into the right turn lane with my signal on and stop at 
the stop line.  Looking left to see if I can make a "right turn on red" and
when I start to move discovered that some idiot has pulled into the bike
lane and is trying to pass me on the right.  GRRR.
   I always do a head check on bike lanes.  Not always for bicycles. . .

	Yup.  Unfortunately, as has been pointed out, the cost of insurance
does NOT go down with No Fault.  The crappiest drivers make out like bandits
because they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for
insurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy
drivers.  The good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of
the crappy drivers' actions, and that's not fair.

	Any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of
shit, because the rest of us end up paying more.

	Any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is
also a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are
inherently less safe than slower drivers, and the NHTSA disproved that two
years ago now.

If you fall with the helmet on and you hit the same spot the helmet landed
on during the drop, the helmet may not protect your head as well as it was
intended to do.  Conservative rec.moto'ers will recommend that you replace
the helmet.  If you want to be sure that it will protect you adequately, you

How about someone letting me know MOTORCYCLE DETAILING TIP #19 ?

The far side of my instrument panel was scuffed when the previous owner
dumped the bike. Same is true for one of the turn signals.

Both of the scuffed areas are black plastic.

I recall reading somewhere, that there was some plastic compound you could coat
the scuffed areas with, then rub it down, ending with a nice smooth shiny 
finish ?

Anyone any ideas.

Continuously, on this forum, and on the street, you find quite a difference
between the opinions of what motorcycling is to different individuals.


(it's why I used trn, instead of rn)

If you have a problem with that, I'm really sorry for you..





Yes, yes, yes.  Motorcycling is slightly different to each and every one of us.  This
is the nature of people, and one of the beauties of the sport.  


And what view exactly is it that every single rider of cruiser bikes holds, a veiw
generalization for us.  Careful, now, you're trying to pigeonhole a WHOLE bunch
of people.


I don't think this is the case, at least not on all jetskis.  On my
friend's jetski, bars turn left to go left.  Anyway, all you're doing
there is changing the yaw of the jets, so the relationship between
(simple linkage could make it work either way).


It seems to me that jetskis are even more irrelevant to this discussion

I can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving,
or something, but it's the BDI that chooses to start and then drive the car
in a known unsafe condition that would (seem to be) liable. Furthermore, they
would have had the last chance to avoid an unsafe situation, which is an
additional factor in attributing "blame".

Anyway, stickers on the window are less effective... no one has any problem
taking a blade to a window to remove a stubborn sticker, but it's a different
story with that that nice paint job on the door....

Yo, Whaz up!!!

Earlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One
guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,
fires...."  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories
about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.

Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and
increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires
increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing
on horsepower numbers.

Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that
but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.
So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.

But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,
but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for
the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,
twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this
translate?  Increased torque should "theoretically" help twins make
more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods
or anything made, just stick 'em in.

Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with
somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than
4's.        

As far as racing teams....  Ducati team "Fast by Ferraci" used
splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James
running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.
Also, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....

Peace.

  I sure hope you got the cost of a replacement panel out of the owner. Here if
the owner should seem reluctant, a stop by the local SPCA (preferably with your
foot/leg all swollen up) to file a viscious dog report would do the trick.



I was very lucky I found a jacket I liked that actually _fits_.
by Just Leather in San Jose. I bought one of the last two they
ever made.

Finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy.  There is a lot
of stuff out there that's fringed everywhere, made of fashion leather,
made to fit men, etc.  I don't know of a shop in your area.  There
are some women rider friendly places in the San Francisco/San Jose
area, but I don't recommend buying clothing mail order.  Too hard
to tell if it'll fit.  Bates custom makes leathers.  You might want
to call them (they're in L.A.) and get a cost estimate for the type
of jacket your wife is interested in.  Large manufacturers like
BMW and H.G. sell women's lines of clothing of decent quality, but
fit is iffy.

A while ago, Noemi and Lisa Sieverts were talking about starting
a business doing just this sort of thing.  Don't know what they
finally decided.

It works for me. I avoid obscenities, and try to remain calm cool and

moving until you apologize." or something more or less benign like that. I 
haven't been shot a single time, but I don't do it in Texas, and I do only 
do it when there are plenty of witnesses around.

  Depends on in what context you want it commented on.  It handles great
compared to some bikes, not so good compared to others.  What would you like
it compared to?  (Yes, I've put a few miles on one, although I've never owned
one).

  Well, you can accomplish both goals, actually, if you have a definite
physical type in mind when you go to these (cough) church meetings..  If
your tastes tend to smaller, more petite (cough) churchgoers, it is more
likely that they will have a smaller head, and you can safely get a medium
or small helmet.

  This works for me, and I traded my spare large helmet with my best friend,
who, at 6'9", tends to look more for women that are over 6'0", and can't
usually fit into the medium size helmet he previously had...

helpful motorcycle rides to, then Ed's advice will hopefully cover any
eventuality as far as legality is concerned, and a spare handtowel in the
tankbag makes acceptable padding so the passenger can see out of the viewport
(rather than the padding above the viewport) in the cases of extreme mismatch.

Bzzzt.  The 750SS is 40 pounds lighter than the 900SS.  I personally,
average rider aboard.  He said it took two fingers on that measely
single front disk to accomplish the task.  How much more brake do
you need?

I haven't gone over 4000 rpm yet (still in break in) and haven't
had a problem with the 750SS being too slow.  The limited steering
lock can be a problem if you aren't prepared for it.  The mirrors
are very good, IMHO.  Someone forgot to tell their designer about
the "whazza behind you, she no matta" philosophy.

Hmmmm.  I don't see a 400, 750 _or_ 900SS in your .sig.  Did I miss
something?

	Ahh, and just how were the carbs rejeted to "match" the changes
you made to the bike? A stage three kit from K/N or Dynojet?

in most any gear. 
	
	Isn't rejetting fun? 


	New CARBS??? Why would that fix it? you still have to get the 
jetting right to match what seems to be a extremely overly lean condition.
You added a more free flowing exhaust, and then higher flowing filters. 
Chances are it's to lean. BUT! This may not be,that's the big fun with 
carb tuning. It's _very_ tricky. 

	Your one and only choice (unless you want to spend many hours
fiddling with the carbs) is to take it to a guy witha  Dyno and have he
tune the carbs for your current set up. Otherwise you'll be playing
a guessing game for a long time...

It's possible there are no other tires available though.

That plastic bodywork is useless. That torque, and an upright riding position is
low torque motor.

chrome has very little impact on buying choice.

Unless motivated solely by price, these are the criteria each rider uses to select
the vehicle of choice. 

To ignore these, as well as other criteria, would be insensitive. In other words,

Step 2) After you become a member, they will ship your bike, UNCRATED to 
just about anywhere across the fruited plain for a few hundred bucks.

I have used this service and have been continually pleased.  They usually
only take a few days for the whole thing, and you do not have to prepare
the bike in any way (other than draining the gas).  Not to mention that
it is about 25% of the normal shipping costs (by the time you crate a bike
and ship it with another company, you can pay around $1000)

No... you can do this? Really? The other morning I went to do a lane change
on the freeway and looked in my mirror, theer was a car there, but far
position, i.e. not accelerating. I triple check with a head turn and decide
I have plenty of room, so I do it, accelerating. I travel about 1/4 mile
staying ~200
feet off teh bumper of the car ahead, and I do a casual mirror check. This
guy is RIGHT on my tail, I mean you couldn't stick a hair between my tire &
his fender. I keep looking in the mirror at him a,d slowly let off teh
throttle. He stays there until I had lost about 15mph and then comes around
me and cuts me off big time. I follow him for about 10 miles and finally
get bored and turn back into work. 

I can file a complaint about this? And actually have the chance to have
something done? How? Who? Where?

something to do with their genetics.  I was putting along at a
mere 20mph or so, gravel road with few loose rocks on it (as in,
just like bad concrete), and 2200lbs of swinging beef jumped a
fence, came out of the ditch, and rammed me!  When I saw her jump
the fence I went for the gas, since she was about 20 feet ahead
of me but a good forty to the side.  Damn cow literally chased me
down and nailed me.  No damage to cow, a bent case guard and a
severely annoyed rider were the only casualties.  If I had my
shotgun I'd still be eating steak.  Nope, if 2200lbs of cow
can hit me when I'm actively evading, forget a much more
manueverable dog.  Just run them over.




	I'll second that.  In addition, I find my hazards to be more
often used than my horn.  At speeds below 40mph on the interstates,
quite common in mountains with trucks, some states require flashers.
In rural areas, flashers let the guy behind you know there is a tractor
with a rather large implement behind it in the way.  Use them whenever 
you need to communicate that things will deviate from the norm.

So it looks like I'm going to have to put a couple of bikes in storage
for a few months, starting several months from now, and I'm already
contemplating how to do it so they're as easy to get going again as
possible. I have everything under control, I think, besides the
batteries. I know that if I buy a $50.00 Battery Tender for each one
and leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage,
they'll be fine. But I'm not sure that's necessary. I've never heard
anyone discussing this idea, so maybe there's some reason why it isn't
so great. But maybe someone can tell me.

Would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries, drain the
electrolyte into separate containers (one for each battery), seal the
container, close up the batteries, and leave them that way? Then it
would seem that when the bikes come out of storage, I could put the
electrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully
charged. What's wrong with this?

On a related, but different note for you Bay Area Denizens, wasn't
there someone who had a bunch of spare EDTA a few months back? Who was

to newbies. 


Bill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steer
tyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the
 motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and
not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously
suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster
or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??



Formal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include
countersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,
from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him
at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,
but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was 
right! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since
then telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But
it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster
or better as a result, is absurd.

Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to
be able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering
theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at

Jeez, Ed, when you started talking about traction management policies I
thought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway
locomotives...

The official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the
front brake is applied first, followed by the rear brake, the idea being
that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. In
practice I suspect most people do what you describe.


If you don't slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you've
achieved maximum braking or not. I'm not suggesting that you should always
limits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. 

In any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep
both wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing





It depends on the bike. Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call
some insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than

For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to get
both feet on the ground when you stop.
 
The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety
Foundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion
of such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you
to ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.

Try calling a motorcycle dealer in your area and asking. It's a good first 
start on how to ride a motorcycle correctly.

perfectly legitimate to drink it away, though I wouldn't spend it that
way myself.







We heard about this from a newspaper article.  Journalists and editors
always pick out the most interesting and sensational "facts" for our
facts get in the way of a good story".  You must have noticed how
motorcyclists get treated by the press.  They thrive on hysteria,
not enough salt to keep taking a pinch of.

perfectly.  Completely smooth.  Not that it runs poorly normally, but
on these days, it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air density
and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete
combustion.  Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.

The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405
freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped
responding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make 
my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then
by pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did
not mind stopping for me.

Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40 
carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws
tight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that
on the screws inside of a carb.  At least it was roadside
fixable and I was on my way in hardly any time.

"R" used to mean race bike, but is now also used to mean sport bike.
"CM" was a "custom" street bike
"CR" is dirt only two strokes
"XL" is dual purpose bike
"XR" was dirt only four stroke, but now can be a dual purpose bike if it has
an "L" as a suffix.
"GL" is a touring bike

                                    


getoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted)
hit the pavement with a "clunk", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the
paint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the
helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a
fiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack.
This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a
wider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam
liner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force.
They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination
of the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or
outside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they
with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would
compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.
(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim
prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)

The bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity
can be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure
is to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet
manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.  Another point
to consider when purchasing a lid.

          "We are the proud, the few and the true Metallibashers!" 
I wanted to let people know that this motorcycle has been sold.

Thanks for your inquiries.

Several years ago, while driving a cage, a dog darted out at a quiet
intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance
between us so I didn't have to slow down. However, a 2nd dog
suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and
the force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier.

Apparently, it was following the 1st dog. Henceforth, if a dog
decides to cross the street, keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as
many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs. 

I've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which
has a pretty loud OEM horn (not as good as Fiamms, but good enuff)
but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of
the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble
getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards. I'd
def feel more vulnerable on my '68 Trump as that'd be easier
leg chewing target for those mongrels.

If there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite
complaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to running
over it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO
compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the
ground by said dog and dies from a head injury. 

Any dog in the neighborhood that's vicious or a public menace
running about unleashed is fair game as road kill candidate.

Help!  I've got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle.  This is great!
Unfortunately, she needs at most a 28" seat.  This is not great.  So far,

So, it's time to tap the collective memory of all the denizens out there.
Anybody know of models (old models and used bikes are not a problem)
she would prefer not to end up with a cruiser.  So there's bonus points
for listing tiny standards.

I seem to remember a thread with a point similar to this passing through

Well, sounds great to me! When I have a real BDI cager tailgating me,
I've found that an effective strategy is to flash my brake light by
pumping the pedal. You will, obviously need a bit of free play in your
brake pedal to do this. It seems that even the most brain dead idiot can
usually discern that a flashing red light directly in front of
him/her/it may mean that something is wrong.

The two problems I'd see with your strategy is that the red light may
change before you can get anything meaningful out of your mouth, or the
occupant(s) may take exception to your opinions and demonstrate such
slim chance, but it would be enough to give me pause.


                
Hello everyone.  I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please.  I don't

to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too 
ignorant to know I need to buy)

2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in 
about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up
till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a 
motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes
a difference)

3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?

4)  In DC, as I imagine it is in every other state (OK, OK, we're not a 
get a learners permit.  However, I'm wondering how one goes about 
learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a) get a liscence
and b) not kill oneself.  I don't know anyone with a bike who could 
teach me, and the most advice I've heard is either "do you live near a
field" or "do you have a friend with a pickup truck", the answers to both
of which are NO.  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for 
the best?  I kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs.
It's still the big city and I'm about a mile from downtown so that 
doesn't seem too viable.  Any stories on how you all learned?

Thanks for any replies in advance.

While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding,
I disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training 
must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion
to know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike 
in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular.
Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among 
new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the 
motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the
direction opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.
is to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the 
motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right 
handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. 
the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries
to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.

The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency 
situations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of
countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.

picked up this cheapo "Motorcycle battery and charging system tester"... 
Hook it up to the battery, it's got 3 lights on "Very good charge"... Start 
the engine (to test the charging system), and it doesn't even REGISTER. It's 
supposed to light 5 or 6 lights if everything is OK, but it stays down at 
the same point as just the battery.
 
 My question here is, if indeed my charging system is just plain messed up, 
how the HECK is the battery staying fully charged? I'd think it would be 
darned near dead from supporting my lights, etc...
 
 Do the '75 CB360T's have a problem with their charging system? Are they 
just generally slower charging than what is normal for bigger bikes?
 
 Is there an easy fix for this?

 Waving at other bikers makes more sense than just "Hey, how's it going,

 1) If you're watching for other bikes to wave to, it means your attention 
is on the road, where it should be, and you're more likely to see cages.
 
 2) It keeps you in the habit of watching really carefully for bikes when 
you're IN a cage. This is a Good Thing.

If you do make it into New York state, the Palisades Interstate Parkway is a
pleasant ride (beautiful scenery, good road surface, minimal traffic).  You
may also want to take a sidetrip along Seven Lakes Drive just off the parkway
for the same reasons plus the road sweeps up and down along the hills with
sweeping turns under old forest canopy.

Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on
his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I

rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to
I also passed my road test.

On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a
I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,
skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the
oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was
also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under
a car and been killed.

Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the
Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training
could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater
since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff
as I did.

So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I
wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you
happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until
you're ready to use it.


While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in
DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you
save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,
plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure
machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration
and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not
including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.


I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200
in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial
coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be
poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo
more expensive.


There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle
recent models might be available.  You could probably look through
past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first
bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice
instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that
are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by
and they were generally set up the way I wanted.

Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting
showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,
were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and
quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence
cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.





Suzuki used to have an L designation, for example my former boss had a
GS850L which had a seat a couple inches lower than the "regular"

	I have a 6' long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley (she
doesn't get out much anymore, so I don't use the lock that often anymore).  It
is made of 3/4" articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable.
It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders, but, unfortunately,

	1) Freeze a link.

	2) Break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well).

	3) Snip through the steel cables (which, I have on authority, are
		frightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters.

	For the same money, you can get a Kryptonite cable lock, which is
anywhere from 1/2" to 7/8" thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shielded
locking mechanism.  I don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's
more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat

Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute.

	FYI, I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck.

Later,
agree with any of this anyway?    I was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs.

Many private places ban bikes.  For example, the famous 17 mile
drive at the Monterrey Peninsula.  And I have stayed at resorts
that sported a "No motorcycles allowed" sign at the entrance.

And there have been public places.  Call the AMA and ask for
Jim Bensberg (sp?) or any one else in their Legislative Office.
They will recound the many public places that they had to bring
to court to reverse their ban on bikes.  That includes everything
from public parks to full cities.  There are probably a few fights
on their books as we now speak.  That is another good reason to
donate to their legislative fund.

So how do I steer when my hands aren't on the bars? (Open Budweiser in left

bike turns, am I countersteering? Is countersteering like benchracing only 
with a taller seat, so your feet aren't on the floor?



No.

Well, my next helmet will be, subject to it fitting well, an AGV

a Shoei task5, and it's getting a little old, and I crashed in
it once a couple of years ago (no hard impact to head...My hip
took care of that.). If price was a consideration I'd get
a Kiwi k21, I hear they are both good and cheap.

Some will, and others will steer with their tuchuses. I don't know how much
the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the
tuchus steerers. I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way,
I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only
started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed
I knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew
in my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it's not a bad idea to
lesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry
about proper handlebar technique.


I have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime during
the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student
would take him for a ride. If the student did not give the instructor the
"you are a sack of potatoes" passenger speech, the instructor would steer
the bike and make a general nuisance of himself. It was amusing to watch,
I'm just happy that it didn't happen to me.


When your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object, there are only four things
liner, the rider's head, the rider's ego (ok, five). Assuming that the helmet/
head assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then in
the other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. If it's the
the liner that's dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were
cracked, it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area. If it's the head
that's getting jiggled, maybe the new gear isn't of as high quality after all?


Here it's driving while impaired. That about covers everything.


It's exactly as dangerous as it looks. You're hard to see and have little
protection. Keeping out of trouble means knowing your limits, keeping your
machine in good shape and being able to predict and make up for every stupid
move that drivers make out there. We deal with it because it's fun, but
staying alive takes a conscious effort.


Look, guy, I doubt anyone here approves of Drunk Driving, but if
he's been caught and convicted and punished maybe you ought to
lighten up? I mean, it isn't like most of us haven't had a few

  Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RS
that was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial power
had to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a 
bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the
in the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was 
NO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of "slip" device in the shaft
to prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!

  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane
do a "stoppy"(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike 
up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend these
activities anymore (now that I'm an "old guy" with kids of my own) but
it looked damn impressive!!

  If you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointed

Well, simply put, drinking is irrelavent.  Driving drunk is indefensable and
unforgivable.  There is a large differnece.

I t was very nice out yesterday in the 'burgh, so i rode my bike
to my gynecologist appointment. When he came in to do the exam,
he noticed my helmet sitting on a chair. He got excited and picked it up 
and started asking all sorts of questions about bikes and dealers in the 
area and the MSF course. Apparently he rode a friends 125 for a
while years ago and recently the bug to ride caught him again.

Another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). I kid you not. If
you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors
that screw into your handlebars, your helmet should fit over your mirror
and be fairly stable. I doubt I have to mention it, but this trick isn't
quite so smart on a GoldWing, CBR600, any GSXR, or any bike with

I was a little surprised, though, to find that you had your helmet on
your seat while you were centerstanding your bike. I usually leave my
helmet on until my bike is parked, if for no other reason than I
wouldn't want my helmet to be on any surface that I was about to start
tilting and jerking . . .


this sort of phrase is typically known as "Japlish."

                                                                                        




No. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when
(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.
The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max
Friz's famous design, but with an overhead "point cam" (see below for
more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground
clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so



This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved
in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting
rods to accomodate the stroke.

The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still
unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and
and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was
required to drive both overhead valves.

Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a
pressurized stream of oil to power the "waterwheel" which kept the lobe
spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal
engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to
normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,
little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the
beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to
pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,
uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).

Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively
firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily
lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even
higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This
was feasible because it was a racing engine.

With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers
because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an

                    /\
                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical
                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the
                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the
                             curvature because there was none in the
                             head itself. The bore curve would start
                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in
                             this diagram


The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of
the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of
finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the
name.

The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it
worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary
technology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that
racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines
were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate
(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two
Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and
down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as
twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern
record of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle
historians discount this story.



                                                                                                          

locks under the Kryptonite name.

When I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite 
a new lock for the bicycle.

For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock
I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in

First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by
the Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of
lock with the Kryptonite name on it.

Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I
don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often
quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes
it would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.

Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves
the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the 
dark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the 
lock mechanism would stand up to an "insert screwdriver and TORQUE"
attack.

Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to 
deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the
weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient
you can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go 
through the cable in well under a minute.





Newbie. Sorry to disappoint you, but as far as the Internet goes I was
in Baghdad while you were still in your dads bag.

Most of the people who made this group interesting 3 or 4 years ago
are no longer around and I only have time to make a random sweep
once a week or so. Hence I missed most of this thread. 

Based on your previous postings, apparently devoid of humour, sarcasm,
wit, or the apparent capacity to walk and chew gum at the same time, I
assumed you were serious. Mea culpa.

Still, it's nice to see that BNR are doing so well that they can afford
to overpay some contractors to sit and read news all day.

OH yes they do! but considering i never wash my BMW (unless i need
to work on it) i never get cuts untill the tools come out.....
altho the best scar (now faded) was from the exhaust piper,
while try to change the oil, after overheating the engine (watch
out for idiot drivers that won't let you pass in the mountains
when you have a rider, case of oil (it was on sale), and case of 
beer), with a drain bolt that decided to seize.

just how does everyone else clean out the area under the transmission
on a BMW R bike? they only way i have found is to remove the
engine and transmission. that and the clutch arm are impossible to
clean (which is wear one of the EC (s&m) are located).

This person is <100 lbs. and fairly small, so I don't see weight as too much
of a problem, but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go?
I've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we're
signals for SLOW DOWN!! or GO FASTER!! or I HAFTA GO PEE!! etc.???

I really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that
she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...

Hey, man, you brought it up.  I agree completely, driving drunk is really
stupid, and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it.  But
DWI is endemic in our society.  It is a REAL problem.  And we, as 
motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk
driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI
accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life 
of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by
motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the
insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public
against those of us who ride responsibly.

In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence.
It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue,
but a genuine safety issue.  So if YOU bring up the subject on rec.moto,
admitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the 
consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.

 BACKGROUND

 The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions 
 roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,
 motosports enthusiasts.

 The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little
 New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada
 Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.

 The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need 
 to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of 
 ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.

 Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to

What is best? Books have been written on that! But in regard to
AeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.
If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero
dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching
the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.
Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very
concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in
protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I
think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a
difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go
somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)
you can just detach and stow the pants. 

One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for
many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and
petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. 

Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I
really that long (I can't imagine how short the standard suits must
be).

An effort was made to remove the sticker.  It came to pieces, leaving
most of it firmly attached to the window.  It was dark, and around
to be torn off) warned the car would be towed if not removed.  A
"reasonable person" would arguably have driven the car.  Had an
accident occured, I don't think my friend's attorney would have much
trouble fixing blame on the apartment mangement.

As a practical matter, even without a conviction, the cost and
inconvenience of defending against the suit would be considerable.

As a moral matter, it was a pretty fucking stupid thing to do for so
paltry a violation as parking without an authorization sticker (BTW, it
parking).



A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime.
That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you
want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty.  Cops are not the
only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who
witnesses a crime can do so.

Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation, give them a
description of the car and the license number, and tell them the
specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute
(ie, search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fill
out the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system any
ticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested, you will have to
appear in court to prosecute.  Your word will not carry the same weight
as a cop's.


Is anyone going to the P.B frenzy at Cadwell park in May.

	When asked what would I most want to try before doing it, 
		     	    I said Death. 

If we do, I think you'd loose.  Sure, you're hand's already on the
throttle.  And your thumb is already near the horn button.  Pushing the
horn button is one simple move.  Revving the throttle requires either
engaging the clutch, or accelerating.  The first is a more complex
manuver than a simple horn button push, and the second ain't too bright
when there is a potential hazard ahead.  Besides, the unique sound of a
horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than
is the sound of an engine, which is what they expect to hear (you are
on the road!).

As is usually the case, a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound
safety procedure.

One day out riding, my friend and i were passing a field of goats and
noticed 2 out on the road. As we slowed to pass the ram made a dash at 
my friend just missing him and then tangling it self up in the barb wire
fence. Being good samaritains and generally nice guys we turned around to 
untrangle the goat from the barbed wire. As I pulled up next to him
(seeing him still tangled up), stopped the bike and got off the Goat had
vanished (into the field I guess).

is an advirtisement for anti freeze.

The Neo Synthetic Oil Company has a reputation for
developing overkill priducts the protect and extend

development. Propylene Glycol, probably the finest radiator 
coolant available. After 100,000 miles of testing, they find
it has a boiling point of 365 degrees (much higher than
pinging, it allows the use of smaller radiators in race cars,
it will not damage aluminum blocks or heads, and it is 
environmentally safe. Yep, this is the good stuff.

If he's not, I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  It's the
be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,
through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.
Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one
improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human
endeavor).


Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd?
Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management
policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or
decrease available traction?  Braking?

It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum
swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most
of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency
situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.


I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which
teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner
that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the
course.


Perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that
point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a
rider's ability.  I find this assertion ludicrous.

This is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing
Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner
compacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or
delaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years
following his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose
up to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have
a video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.

Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and
other relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the
comfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously
degrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of
"parking your lid" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the
comfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly

dangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the 
activity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot
faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is
not unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective
clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,
you are likely to be less severely injured.

First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,
control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.

Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet
and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy 
piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking
boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine
for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay 
tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps
pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,
preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for
a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though
more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another
leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.

Geez, what happened?  She got a ticket for driving too slow???


Oh, are you saying you're not an edu.breath, then?  Okay.


Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,
the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, 
became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I
took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.
They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours
surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.

Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,
50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat
Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.
Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one
MSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on
the back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that
Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like
a big moto party.

After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,
and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/
parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from 
the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else
into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the 
ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of
bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.

Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could 
think was "big".  Then I put one foot up.  "Heavy" came to mind very
nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.

By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even
on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that 
did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is
on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north
of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95
splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access
highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, 
On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about
30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many
thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.

Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along
in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane 
changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this 
thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the
fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was
Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,
but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless
buzz.

The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the
decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  
The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok
in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack
find "Spencer", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting
through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.

About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal
for "hold on tight".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second
gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a 
short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light
traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.
Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort
lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went 
until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed
there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, 

Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the "get
off in a mile" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted
slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could 
see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed
to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad
out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put
the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side
stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.


My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,
hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than 
list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.

	You'll likely not notice her weight too much.  A piece of advice
wee bit more slowly than usual.  Consciously worry about spitting her off
the back.  It's as much your job to keep her on the pillion as it is hers,
and I guarantee she'll be put off by the bike ripping out from under her
when you whack it open.  Keep the lean angles pretty tame the first time
out too.  You and her need to learn each other's body English.  She needs
to learn what your idea is about how to take the turn, and you need to
learn her idea of "shit!  Don't crash now!" so you don't work at cross
purposes while leaned over.  You can work up to more aggressive riding over
time.

	I've never liked my passengers to try and shift their weight with the

	unnerving. It's one thing if they're just getting comfortable or
	decide to look over your other shoulder, but I don't recommend having
	him/her shift her weight with each turn... too violent.
	
	Also (I think someone already said this) make sure your passenger
	wears good gear. I sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or
	lacking other safety gear (depends on how squidly I feel) but I
	won't let passengers do it. What I do to myself I can handle, but
	I wouldn't want to hurt anyone else, so I don't let them on without


	handle bars that your passenger does not. Don't make her feel like
	she's going to slide off the back, and "snappy" turns for you are
	sickening lurches for her. In general, it feels much less controlled
	and smooth as a passenger. I can't stand being on the back of my

You and the Beav should lighten up (esp the Beav).  I agree that
DUI/DWI is serious.  We should have reasonable laws, strict
enforcement, and tough sentences.  But, Andrew did not
post "looking for sympathy over the consequences."  He posted
asking for advice because he had an extremely high quote.  His
post was obviously valid because he later found insurance for LESS.
He noted why he was in his predicament but did not defend in
any way drunk driving (and has renounced drunk driving).  There
are too many repeat offenders to worry about and other BDC.
Why try to make this person who is no longer part of the problem
an outcast?  He has paid his debt to society.  Step off the high
horse.  We have all been irresponsible in the past.

With that said, I'm guilty of the same type of hostility towards
rapists.  I think it comes because I feel the punishment is not
severe enough.  The same may be true of DWI/DUI. If that is the
case, then it is our stinkin' gubment we need to change.  If 
we had a reasonable law about DWI/DUI with a stiff penalty
then fewer people would do it.  

At any rate, Andrew as paid his debt as defined by the law.
If you think that debt is actually greater than the law mandates, 
tell your 'representatives'.

I've got a Belstaff tankbag on my FJ1100, and it ain't too good. It's
difficult to fix it securely cos of the the tank/fairing/sidepanel layout,
and also with the bars on full lock the bag touches the handlebar switches,
so you get the horn on full left lock and the starter motor on full right!!
If I was buying another I think I'd go for a magnetic one.

is part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  Do
I remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without
screwing it down before reading?

The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B on
the head cover.  I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do
you know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?

My headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy, brighter
replacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one?

As always, I very much appreciate your help.  The weather in Philadelphia

	I'm thinking about becoming a bike owner this year
w/o any bike experience thus far.  I figure that getting a

and who want's to ride a bus).  I'm looking for advice

quit whirring of newer engines is more to my liking.

I've experienced this, back when I was young(er) and (more) foolish...

My first bike used to track extremely true.  Going down the highway,
I would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas
steady, slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest, riding
without any hands.  If I needed to turn, I'd shift my weight into the
turn, and lo and behold, the bike would turn, sans touching the bars!
Granted, it wouldn't turn very fast, but it proves that you can turn
a bike without countersteering, at least not in terms of the input
to the bar normally associated with countersteering.

As I've said, I know many people who think all you do is lean, and any
input they're giving to the bar is totally unconscious.  Whereas that
may be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances,
possibly for years at a stretch, I can't think of anybody who'd argue
that this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar
in a turn, regardless of what you want to call it.

Hola amigos,

Quiero... I need an answer to a pressing question.  I now own two
bikes and would love to keep them both.  One is a capable and
smooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and great
great on the long road and backroad.  A good start at a stable, but
I don't think it's going to work.  Unfortunately, insurance is going
to pluck me by the short hairs.  

do this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of 
driving one of the things at a time.  I don't think I'll ever manage
to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (Turn left...
anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to
discount your rates?  State Farm doesn't.

By the way, I'm moving to the Bay area so I'll be insuring the bikes
there, and registering them.  To ease me of the shock, can somebody
guesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS?  Here in Tucson
they only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two,
per annum.

HOWEVER, all this macho shit aside, the fact is that when you are

that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans

By all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention,
STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a

I have a cheap solar charger that I keep in my car.  I purchased it via
some mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would
run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car.
Knowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so, I purchased the charger.
Believe it or not, the thing worked.  The battery held a charge and
energetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just
sitting.

Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun
wasn't strong enough due to its low angle.

I think I paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  There are more powerful, more
expensive ones, but I purchased the cheapest one I could find.

keep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged.

to fit a bigger sprocket.

I'd be inclined to take two teeth off the rear for a 5% ratio
change rather than adding one to the front for about 7%.  If you
raise the overall gear ratio too much you'll impair the bike's
rideability, because the gears will be far enough apart that
there will be only one gear that provides adequate response at
any given speed.  Honda 750s don't have the widest of power

I had a DWI in 91 and for the beemer, as a rec.
vehicle, it'll cost me almost $1200 bucks to insure/year.

Now what do I do?

(I could probably just sell the bike and return my DoD number,...
)


OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.

We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why
one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,
is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to
design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and
see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of
us who have bikes are familiar.

Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its
own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to
get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches
to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to
remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,
through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the
same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along 
a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change 
surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact 
patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It 
probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, 
but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like 
because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a 
better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch
forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.
You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it
was the rotation that did it.

Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and
direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them
about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.
How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking
for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not
or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged
like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.
I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like
that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.
Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try
one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in
a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very
much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.
So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,
a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have
countersteering.

real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations
of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm 
willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. 

If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's
behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.


True enough. I put it on the ground if it's free of spooge, or directly
on my head otherwise.


Not exactly. The helmet has a lot less energy if your head isn't in it, and
there's no lump inside to compress the liner against the shell. Is a drop
off the seat enough to crack the shell? I doubt it, but you can always
send it to be inspected.


Well, I used to get mad, and either try to communicate my anger to jerks,
or to, uhm, educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic.
Now I just try to get them off my tail.

In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in
front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the 
jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch
better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than
from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.

In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass,
I might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name,
(still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.  

my adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.  

A ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for
me) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case,
cage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike. 

On the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last
vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk
waiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing
illegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).

Like almost everything here, your choices and mileage will vary.

"Get the organization to act on it" is easy to say, but says little
about what one really can and should do.  What the organization
actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors,
as far as I can see.  That's what makes it so important to vote in an
election of officers.

It does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active (in
the state and national arenas, not infighting) than other M/C
organizations.  Should we change this?  Or just join the other groups
that already are in politics?

(Incidentally, the political hazards to motorcycle riders in the US at
the moment don't compare to the problems of some other groups like gun
owners.  Just try to take up target pistol shooting in the Northeast
or California, and I bet you'll wish you only had to worry about
wearing a helmet.  (Why does every thread on rec.moto eventually come
around to guns?))

Well, I'd say you're mostly right, but for different reasons. (BTW, as of a
couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750
GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that
order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily
them honest about acquiring parts. 

HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.
not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the 
plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy,
then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it
on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,
more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.

The specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal
"street strategy", like SIPDE for example, was the most important
component of any rider education curriculum.  The specific skills of
emergency braking, cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced
as well, but more significant was that 35% of rider did NOTHING
confronted with a potential accident, and another third collided or
fell over as a result of rider error.  The choice of specific maneuver
is much less significant to the outcome than early detection and
the proper execution of ANY effective countermeasure.

I was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came 
flashing through the brush at well over 30mph, on an intercept course with 
my front wheel. The dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard 
me and still had a lead when it hit the road. The dog was approaching from

the road before I went by. Rover was looking back at me to calculate the

swerved into my lane. The squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back 
home, but I haven't seen it since. 

Sniff.

What about the new Yamaha "Cyclelok" ?
From the photo in Motorcyclist, it looks the same hardened steel as a 
Kryptonite U lock, except it folds in five places.
It seems to extend out far enough to lock the rear tire to the tube of
a parking sign or similar.

Anyone had any experience with them, how easy is it to attack the lock
at the jointed sections ?

something. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the

didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my

the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to
harm.

left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he
had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,
heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I
saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took
the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was
driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent
marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think
I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this
moment is hazy.

I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The
apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut
mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my
shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.
So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!

Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never
moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike
off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some
gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me
here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.

prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not
necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was
riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if
it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the
thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a
long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?

I eagerly await comment.

were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an
instead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run
at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.

The real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for
the front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon
Roadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger
than that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,
and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first
motorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner
tube qualities?

The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current
rear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought
100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be
very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.

I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the
front and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer 
lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and
FJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive
behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable
back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving
much better tire milage life. Any comments?

A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very
good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to
mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be
careful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to
check out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and
I havn't had a chance to check the rim type.

On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)
Vetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually
I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be
fork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame
mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower
runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly
accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'
style. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is
just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)

Like most everyone else, I ended up getting two different sizes for
the top and bottom.  My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the
bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the
46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have
large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get
size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's
when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).

I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are
in some way different from us real folks.

Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn
wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.
I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a
store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom
in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my
leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall
stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),
and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be

As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably
equal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece
provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by
3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around
the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.

So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit,
I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I
own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.

the odds since there were multiple complaints both ways and the judge had
a history of finding everyone guilty of at least something, so he convinced
us (she came without a lawyer) to drop everything.  The net result was
a $500 laywer bill for me and $35 court costs for her.

The only consolation was that she had trouble scraping together the $35
while $500 is not quite one week's beer money for me...

Greetings netters,


Well I have the mother of all locks. On Friday the 16th of April I took
possesion of a 12' Cobra Links lock, 1" diameter. This was a special order.

I weighs a lot. I had to carry it home and it was digging into my shoulder
after about two blocks.

I have currently a Kryptonite Rock Lock through the front wheel, a HD
padlock for the steering lock, a Master padlock to lock the cover to two
front spokes, and the Cobra Links through the rear swing arm and around a
post in an underground parking garage.

Next Friday the 30th I have an appointment to have an alarm installed on
me bike.

When I travel the Cobra Links and the cover and padlock stay at home.

By the way. I also removed the plastic mesh that is on the Cobra Links
and encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes (two of
them) I got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the Cobra Links. The
guys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much
and the inner tubes were free.

Later.

Okay DoD'ers, here's a goddamn mystery for ya !

Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there
to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very
tangible "thunk".  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. 
My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such
that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the
little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a
mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the
mystery.

The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm
fairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of
the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in
the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something
having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  

rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without
that Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly
changes phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid
?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.  In the meantime, life

Dogs will chase anything that moves. I have two dogs and they love
chasing me when I ride off. They will also chase any car that passes
, running along the footpath/sidewalk at up to 60kph. They don't
seem to go after trucks though, the size difference must be a factor.

It also works in my favour though, I can exercise them quite easily
by riding 1/2 mile up the road and back a few times.
